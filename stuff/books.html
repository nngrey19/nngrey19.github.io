              I did not appreciate this book immediately. I found the first third or so to be a slog. The writing is good and the story is easy enough to follow, but the subject matter is bleak: alcoholism, poverty, childhood confusion over sexuality, bullying, unrequited love, promiscuity. In fact, the characters' troubles were so consistent, they almost seemed to be gratuitous.

                I was tempted to put the book down more than once. I am glad I didn’t because somewhere along the line it began to grow on me. The tone never changed, but the characters evolved. While they initially struck me as caricatures of woe and misery, something about the way they kept on going despite it all gave them substance. They had their little triumphs, showed persistence in the face of terrible odds and regular failure, and displayed a form of flawed but believable humanity.

              It is not an extraordinary book, but it is a good one, bordering on very good. The writing carries the story without calling attention to itself, except occasionally when it attempts to capture the vernacular. The setting is well constructed. I would say “vivid” if grays and blacks could be vivid. The plotting is gentle but persistent. It pulls us inexorably toward disaster, and yet when disaster finally comes, the horror of it has lost its power. You have learned that people can take a lot, and they survive because the opposite is worse. In a way, they come to represent all of us and the human condition, their failings and their fortitude are our own.
