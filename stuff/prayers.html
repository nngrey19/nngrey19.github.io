          <h3>The Great Hymn to the Aten</h3>
        
          <p>You rise in beauty on the horizon of the sky,<br>
              O Living Aten, source of all life.</p>
        
          <p>When you ascend in the eastern light,<br>
              You fill every land with your radiance.<br>
              Your brilliance reaches to the farthest corners —<br>
              Even the unknown lands receive your light.</p>

          <p>Though you are high above,<br>
            Your rays touch the earth below.<br>
            Though your form is hidden,<br>
            Your presence is known through what you sustain.</p>
        
          <p>The world is brought to life by your hand.<br>
              Plants grow, trees blossom, birds sing,<br>
              Their wings outstretched in praise of your spirit.</p>
        
          <p><strong>O Aten, Living Sun,</strong><br>
              You are eternal, you are one.<br>
              The earth rejoices in your sight,<br>
              And I rejoice in your great light.</br>

              <p><i>The earth rejoices in your light,<br>
              And I rejoice in you.</i></p>

          <p><i>Aten was originally just the physical sun disk, but during the reign of Akhenaten, Aten was elevated to the one true god in a brief experiment with monotheism.</i></p>

          <h3>Gayatri Mantra</h3>
          
            <p>Om bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ</br>
            <i>ohm bhoor bhoo-vah swa-ha</i></p>

            <p>dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayāt</br>
            <i>dhee-yo yo nah prah-cho-da-yaat</i></p>
          
          <p>Translation:<br>
             We meditate on the divine light of Savitr (the Sun),<br>
             Who illuminates all realms: earth, atmosphere, and heavens.<br>
             May that divine brilliance inspire and guide our thoughts.</p>

          <p><i>One of the most revered hymns from the Rig Veda, dedicated to Surya, the sun god.</i></p>

          <h3>Orphic Hymn to Selene</h3>
          <p>(Traditional Invocation, circa 2nd century CE)</p>
        
          <p>Hear me, lovely Selene,<br>
          shining queen of the night,<br>
          all-seeing and joyful, light-bringer to mortals.</p>
        
          <p>Bull-horned Moon, wandering quietly through the heavens,<br>
          swift-footed and beautiful,<br>
          Mother of months and timekeeper of the night.</p>
        
          <p>Radiant in your golden crown,<br>
          you ride your long-maned horses across the heavens,<br>
          and in silence you gaze upon the sleeping Earth.</p>
        
          <p>Lamp of the night,<br>
          gleaming guide through darkness,<br>
          nourisher of all growth,<br>
          friend to women and lovers,<br>
          companion of the mysteries.</p>
        
          <p>Come, blessed goddess,<br>
          shine your gentle light upon us,<br>
          and bring peace and healing in the cool hours of the night.</p>

          <p><i>Selene is the ancient Greek goddess of the Moon — a luminous, divine figure who drives her silver chariot across the night sky.</i></p>
        
          <h3>Incan Hymn to Mama Killa (Peru)</h3>
        
          <p>Silver mother, Lady of the night sky,<br>
            Your light touches the lakes and mountains.<br>
            Watch over us, your children,<br>
            and bring calm to the dark.</p>

          <p><i>Mama Killa was the moon goddess and protector of women.</i></p>
          
          <h3>Sumerian Prayer to Adad</h3>

          <p>O Adad, bring forth the rain!<br>
            Bring forth the clouds from the sky.<br>
            May the river swell, may the crops grow tall,<br>
            May the land drink deeply and be fertile.</p>
          <p>In Sumerian culture, Adad (or Ishkur) was the god of storms and rain. </p>
