          <h3>The Great Hymn to the Aten</h3>
        
          <p>You rise in beauty on the horizon of the sky,<br>
              O Living Aten, source of all life.</p>
        
          <p>When you ascend in the eastern light,<br>
              You fill every land with your radiance.<br>
              Your brilliance reaches to the farthest corners —<br>
              Even the unknown lands receive your light.</p>

          <p>Though you are high above,<br>
            Your rays touch the earth below.<br>
            Though your form is hidden,<br>
            Your presence is known through what you sustain.</p>
        
          <p>The world is brought to life by your hand.<br>
              Plants grow, trees blossom, birds sing,<br>
              Their wings outstretched in praise of your spirit.</p>
        
          <p><strong>O Aten, Living Sun,</strong><br>
              You are eternal, you are one.<br>
              The earth rejoices in your light,<br>
              And I rejoice in you.</p>

          <p><i>Aten was originally just the physical sun disk, but during the reign of Akhenaten, Aten was elevated to the one true god in a brief experiment with monotheism.</i></p>

          <h3>Gayatri Mantra</h3>
          
          <p>Om bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ<br>
            tat-savitur vareṇyaṁ<br>
            bhargo devasya dhīmahi<br>
            dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayāt.</p>

            <p>Om bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ</br>
            <i>ohm bhoor bhu-vah svah</i></p>

            <p>tat-savitur vareṇyaṁ</br>
            <i>tut sah-vee-toor va-rayn-yum</i></p>

            <p>bhargo devasya dhīmahi</br>
            <i>bhahr-go day-vah-sya dhee-ma-hi</i></p>

            <p>dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayāt</br>
            <i>dhee-yo yo nah prah-cho-da-yaat</i></p>
          
          <p>Translation:<br>
             We meditate on the divine light of Savitṛ (the Sun),<br>
             Who illuminates all realms: earth, atmosphere, and heavens.<br>
             May that divine brilliance inspire and guide our thoughts.</p>

          <p><i>One of the most revered hymns from the Rig Veda, dedicated to Surya, the sun god.</i></p>

          <h3>The Hymn to Selene</h3>
        
          <p>You rise in silence, silver-veiled,<br>
            O Selene, Queen of the Night.</p>
        
          <p>Draped in glowing mist, you ascend the sky,<br>
            Your white light flowing across the dark.<br>
            Calm-eyed guardian of the stars,<br>
            You move with grace among the heavens.</p>
        
          <p>You see the secrets that sunlight hides,<br>
            The thoughts unspoken, the dreams not yet born.<br>
            Your radiance soothes the restless soul,<br>
            And guides the wanderer home.</p>
        
          <p>O Selene, shining mother of stillness,<br>
            Grant me serenity in your cool light.<br>
            May my thoughts be clear as your reflection,<br>
            My heart steady as your arc.</p>

          <p><i>Selene is the ancient Greek goddess of the Moon — a luminous, divine figure who drives her silver chariot across the night sky.</i></p>
        
          <h3>Incan Hymn to Mama Killa (Peru)</h3>
        
          <p>Silver mother, Lady of the night sky,<br>
            Your light touches the lakes and mountains.<br>
            Watch over us, your children,<br>
            and bring calm to the dark.</p>

          <p><i>Mama Killa was the moon goddess and protector of women.</i></p>
