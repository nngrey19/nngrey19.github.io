          <h3>Prayers</h3>
          <p><i>Adapted for Ritual or Meditation</i></p>

          <h3>Morning</h3>
          <p>I give You thanks, O Lord, for You have mercifully restored my soul. Great is Your faith in me.</p>

          <h3>Evening</h3>
          <p>May it be Your will that I lie down in peace and that I arise in peace.</p>

          <h3>For the Sun</h3>
          <h4>Exerpt from The Great Hymn to the Aten</h4>

          <p>You appear beautiful on the horizon of the sky,<br>
             O living Aten, Beginning of life!<br>
             When you rise on the eastern horizon,<br>
             You fill every land with your beauty.</p>
            
          <p>You are beauteous, great, radiant, high over every land;<br>
             Your rays embrace the lands to the limit of all that you made.<br>

          <p>Those on earth come from your hand as you made them.<br>
             When you have dawned, they live.<br>
             When you set, they die.<br>
             You yourself are lifetime; one lives by you.</p>
            
          <p>All eyes are on your beauty until you set.<br>
             All labor is put down when you rest in the west.</p>

          <p>Earth brightens when you rise on the horizon,<br>
             When you shine as Aten by day.<br>
             You dispel the darkness,<br>
             You cast your rays, and the Two Lands are in festivity.</p>

          <h3>Orphic Hymn 78: To Eos (Dawn)</h3>
          <h4>Translation by Apostolos N. Athanassakis & Benjamin M. Wolkow</h4>
        
          <p>Hear me, O blessed Dawn, mother of the stars and dew,<br>
          rosy-armed and divine, brimming with noble light.</p>
        
          <p>You come in your chariot drawn by holy steeds,<br>
          you drive through the sky with your light-bringing whip,</p>
        
          <p>O maiden clothed in saffron, you beam out your light,<br>
          you carry the flame that gives men life.</p>
        
          <p>Mortals and immortals alike cry out in joy at your rising,<br>
          as you shine on all things with your brilliant fire.</p>
        
          <p>Ever youthful and fresh, you chase away the darkness,<br>
          you open the gates of the sky for the shining Sun.</p>
        
          <p>Come, blessed goddess, bringer of light and day,<br>
             drive away evil dreams and keep sweet sleep away.</p>

          <h3>For the Moon</h3>
          <h4>Orphic Hymn to Selene</h4>

          <p>Lucid and Pontiac</p>
          
          <p>Splendid bringer of light,<br>
          bull-horned goddess Moon,<br>
          crossing the sky,<br>
          racing through night,<br>
          we honor you.</p>

          <p>Stars attend your orbit<br>
          as you glide,<br>
          a torch in the darkness,<br>
          waxing and waning,<br>
          male and female.<br>
          We honor you.</p>

          <p>Brooding amber<br>
          shining in the night,<br>
          all-seeing vigilance<br>
          in the sky of stars,<br>
          evening’s splendor,<br>
          like a jewel you offer<br>
          fulfillment and favor.</p>

          <p>In your long cloak of shadow<br>
          moving in circles,<br>
          you shepherd the Milky Way.<br>
          Holy and gentle lady of the stars,<br>
          let your light shine<br>
          and save us.</p>

          <h3>Hymn to Inanna as the Morning Star (Sumerian, c. 2000 BCE)</h3>
          <p>At evening you appear in the heavens,<br>
             you shine like the star of the heavens.<br>
             At morning you rise in glory,<br>
             your radiance fills the sky like fine oil.</p>

          <p>Inanna: Queen of Heaven and Earth by Diane Wolkstein & Samuel Noah Kramer</p>

          <h3>For the Rain</h3>
          <p>O Adad, let the cool rain fall!<br>
             Let dark clouds spread across the sky.<br>
             May the river rise and crops grow tall,<br>
             May the land drink deep as the storms pass by.</p>

          <h3>Modeh Ani</h3>

          <h3>The Great Hymn to the Aten</h3>
          <h4>Translation by Miriam Lichtheim</h4>
        
          <p>You appear beautiful on the horizon of the sky,<br>
          O living Aten, Beginning of life!<br>
          When you rise on the eastern horizon,<br>
          You fill every land with your beauty.</p>
        
          <p>You are beauteous, great, radiant, high over every land;<br>
          Your rays embrace the lands to the limit of all that you made.<br>
          Being Re, you reach their limits,<br>
          You bend them for your beloved son.</p>
        
          <p>Though you are far, your rays are on earth;<br>
          Though seen by no one, your movements are known.</p>
        
          <p>When you set on the western horizon,<br>
          The land is in darkness, in the manner of death.<br>
          Sleepers are in their chambers, heads covered,<br>
          One eye does not see the other.</p>
        
          <p>All their goods are stolen, even though under their heads,<br>
          And they are unaware of it.<br>
          Every lion comes out from its den,<br>
          All the serpents bite;</p>
        
          <p>Darkness hovers, earth is silent,<br>
          For he who made them rests on his horizon.</p>
        
          <p>Earth brightens when you rise on the horizon,<br>
          When you shine as Aten by day.<br>
          You dispel the darkness,<br>
          You cast your rays, and the Two Lands are in festivity.</p>
        
          <p>Awake they stand on their feet,<br>
          You have raised them up.<br>
          Their limbs cleansed, they don their clothing,<br>
          Their arms uplifted in praise at your rising.</p>
        
          <p>The entire land performs its work:<br>
          All cattle are satisfied with their pasturage;<br>
          Trees and plants flourish,<br>
          The birds flutter from their nests,<br>
          Their wings greeting your Ka.</p>
        
          <p>All flocks skip on their feet,<br>
          All that fly and alight live as you rise for them.</p>
        
          <p>Ships fare north, fare south as well,<br>
          Every road is open at your rising.<br>
          Fish in the river leap before you,<br>
          Your rays are in the midst of the sea.</p>
        
          <p>You make the seed in women,<br>
          You create the fluid in men,<br>
          You give life to the son in his mother's womb,<br>
          You soothe him that he may not weep,<br>
          You nurse him in the womb, giving breath to sustain all that you made.</p>
        
          <p>When he comes forth from the womb to breathe<br>
          On the day of his birth,<br>
          You open his mouth completely,<br>
          You provide for his needs.</p>
        
          <p>When the chick cries in the egg-shell,<br>
          You give him breath within it to keep him alive;<br>
          When you have made him fully, he breaks the shell<br>
          And comes forth from the egg to announce his completion,<br>
          Walking on his legs as he comes forth.</p>
        
          <p>How manifold it is, what you have made!<br>
          They are hidden from sight,<br>
          O Sole God beside whom there is none!</p>
        
          <p>You made the earth according to your desire,<br>
          While you were alone:<br>
          All men, herds, and flocks,<br>
          All upon earth that walk on legs,<br>
          All on high that fly with their wings,</p>
        
          <p>The lands of Khor and Kush,<br>
          The land of Egypt—<br>
          You set every man in his place,<br>
          You supply their needs,<br>
          Everyone has his food,<br>
          His lifetime is counted.</p>
        
          <p>Their tongues differ in speech,<br>
          Their characters likewise;<br>
          Their skins are distinct,<br>
          For you distinguished the peoples.</p>
        
          <p>You made the Nile in the netherworld,<br>
          You bring it up at your desire to keep them alive,<br>
          For you made them for yourself:</p>
        
          <p>O Lord of all of them, laboring for them,<br>
          O Aten of daytime, great in glory!</p>
        
          <p>All distant lands, you make them live,<br>
          You have placed a Nile in the sky that it may fall for them,<br>
          Making floods on the mountains like the sea<br>
          To water their fields among their towns.</p>
        
          <p>How excellent are your ways, O Lord of eternity!<br>
          A Nile in the sky for the foreign peoples<br>
          And for all the creatures of the desert that go on foot—<br>
          Yet the real Nile comes from the underworld for Egypt.</p>
        
          <p>Your rays nurse all fields:<br>
          When you rise they live, they grow for you.<br>
          You make the seasons in order to rear all that you made:<br>
          The winter to cool them,<br>
          The heat that they may taste you.</p>
        
          <p>You made the distant sky in order to rise in it,<br>
          In order to see all that you make.<br>
          While you were alone,<br>
          Rising in your form as the living Aten,<br>
          Appearing, shining, withdrawing or approaching,</p>
        
          <p>You made millions of forms from yourself alone:<br>
          Cities, towns, fields, the river's course.<br>
          All eyes see you above them<br>
          As you are the Aten of the daytime on high.</p>
        
          <p>You are in my heart,<br>
          There is no other who knows you<br>
          Except your son Neferkheperure, Sole-one-of-Re<br>
          Whom you have taught your ways and your might.</p>
        
          <p>Those on earth come from your hand as you made them.<br>
          When you have dawned, they live.<br>
          When you set, they die.<br>
          You yourself are lifetime; one lives by you.</p>
        
          <p>All eyes are on your beauty until you set.<br>
          All labor is put down when you rest in the west.</p>
        
          <p>You establish the world, and raise up what you made.<br>
          You are in my heart, and there is no one else who knows you<br>
          But for your son, whom you have taught your ways.</p>
        
          <p>He who rises in your name shall live forever and ever.</p>
          <p><i>Aten was originally just the physical sun disk, but during the reign of Akhenaten, Aten was elevated to the one true god in a brief experiment with monotheism.</i></p>

          <p><strong>O Aten, Living Sun,</strong><br>
            You are eternal, you are one.<br>
            The earth rejoices in your light,<br>
            And I rejoice at your first sight.</br>

          <p>Translation:<br>
             We meditate on the divine light of Savitr (the Sun),<br>
             Who illuminates all realms: earth, atmosphere, and heavens.<br>

          <h3>Orphic Hymn to Selene</h3>

          <p>Athanassakis & Wolkow</p>
          <p>Hear me, O divine queen,<br>
          O light-bringing and splendid Selene, O bull-horned Moon,<br>
          crossing the air as you race with night.<br>
          Nocturnal, torch-bearing, maiden of beautiful stars, O Moon,<br>
          waxing and waning,<br>
          feminine and masculine,<br>
          luminous, lover of horses,<br>
          mother of time, bearer of fruit,<br>
          amber-colored, moody,<br>
          shining in the night, all-seeing and vigilant,<br>
          surrounded by beautiful stars, you delight in the quiet<br>
          and in the richness of the night,<br>
          you grant fulfillment and favor<br>
          as, like a jewel, you shine in the night.</p>

          <p>Long-cloaked marshal of the stars,<br>
          wise maiden whose motion is circular,<br>
          come, O blessed and gentle lady,<br>
          lady of the stars, through your own light<br>
          shine and save, O maiden,<br>

            and bring calm to the dark.</p>

          <p><i>Mama Killa was the moon goddess and protector of women.</i></p>

            May the river swell, may the crops grow tall,<br>
            May the land drink deeply and be fertile.</p>
