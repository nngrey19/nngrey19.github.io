          <h3>Prayers</h3>
          <p><i>Adapted for Ritual or Meditation</i></p>

          <h3>The Great Hymn to the Aten</h3>
        
          <p>You rise in beauty on the horizon of the sky,<br>
              O Living Aten, source of all life.</p>
        
          <p>When you ascend in the eastern light,<br>
              You fill every land with your radiance.<br>
              Your brilliance reaches to the farthest corners —<br>
              Even the unknown lands receive your light.</p>

          <p>Though you are high above,<br>
            Your rays touch the earth below.<br>
            Though your form is hidden,<br>
            Your presence is known through what you sustain.</p>
        
          <p>The world is brought to life by your hand.<br>
              Plants grow, trees blossom, birds sing,<br>
              Their wings outstretched in praise of your spirit.</p>
        
          <p><strong>O Aten, Living Sun,</strong><br>
              You are eternal, you are one.<br>
              The earth rejoices in your light,<br>
              And I rejoice in you.</p>

          <p><i>Aten was originally just the physical sun disk, but during the reign of Akhenaten, Aten was elevated to the one true god in a brief experiment with monotheism.</i></p>

          <h3>Gayatri Mantra</h3>
          
            <p>Om bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ</br>
            <i>ohm bhoor bhoo-vah swa-ha</i></p>

            <p>tat-savitur vareṇyaṁ</br>
            <i>taht sah-vee-toor va-rayn-yum</i></p>

            <p>bhargo devasya dhīmahi</br>
            <i>bhahr-go day-vah-sya dhee-ma-hee</i></p>

            <p>dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayāt</br>
            <i>dhee-yo yo nah prah-cho-da-yaat</i></p>
          
          <p>Translation:<br>
             We meditate on the divine light of Savitr (the Sun),<br>
             Who illuminates all realms: earth, atmosphere, and heavens.<br>
             May that divine brilliance inspire and guide our thoughts.</p>

          <p><i>One of the most revered hymns from the Rig Veda, dedicated to Surya, the sun god.</i></p>

          <h3>The Hymn to Selene</h3>
        
          <p>You rise in silence, silver-veiled,<br>
            O Selene, Queen of the Night.</p>
        
          <p>Draped in glowing mist, you ascend the sky,<br>
            Your white light flowing across the dark.<br>
            Calm-eyed guardian of the stars,<br>
            You move with grace among the heavens.</p>
        
          <p>You see the secrets that sunlight hides,<br>
            The thoughts unspoken, the dreams not yet born.<br>
            Your radiance soothes the restless soul,<br>
            And guides the wanderer home.</p>
        
          <p>O Selene, shining mother of stillness,<br>
            Grant me serenity in your cool light.<br>
            May my thoughts be clear as your reflection,<br>
            My heart steady as your arc.</p>

          <p><i>Selene is the ancient Greek goddess of the Moon — a luminous, divine figure who drives her silver chariot across the night sky.</i></p>
        
          <h3>Incan Hymn to Mama Killa (Peru)</h3>
        
          <p>Silver mother, Lady of the night sky,<br>
            Your light touches the lakes and mountains.<br>
            Watch over us, your children,<br>
            and bring calm to the dark.</p>

          <p><i>Mama Killa was the moon goddess and protector of women.</i></p>
          
          <h3>Sumerian Prayer to Adad</h3>

          <p>O Adad, bring forth the rain!<br>
            Bring forth the clouds from the sky.<br>
            May the river swell, may the crops grow tall,<br>
            May the land drink deeply and be fertile.</p>
          <p>In Sumerian culture, Adad (or Ishkur) was the god of storms and rain. </p>

          <h3>Modeh Ani</h3>
          <p>Modeh ani lefenecha melech chai vekaiyam, shey-he-chezarta bay nishmati b’chemla, raba emunatecha</p>

          <p>Moh-deh Ah-nee Leh-fah-neh-chah (I thank You before You)<br>

             Meh-lekh Khai V'Kah-yam (King, living and eternal)<br>

             Sheh-heh-khuh-zahr-tah Bee Nish-mah-tee (You have restored my soul within me)<br>

             B'khem-lah-khah Rah-bah (With Your great mercy)</p>

             <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hebreways/video/7410325055130946824">link</a>
            
            I give You thanks, living and eternal Spirit, for You have mercifully restored my soul (breathe). Great is Your faithful in me.</p>

            <h3>Bedtime Shema</h3>
            <p>May it be Your will, Lord my God and God of my ancestors,<br> 
              that I lie down in peace and that I arise in peace.</p>
