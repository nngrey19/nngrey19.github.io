            <div class="sans mt12"><b> Medieval Period, 500 - 1400</b></div>
            <p>Characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Modal System</b>: Medieval music was primarily based on a system of modes, which were melodic patterns or scales. Modes provided a framework for composing and improvising melodies, and each mode had its own distinct characteristics and emotional qualities.</li>
              <li><b>Monophonic Texture</b>: Most medieval music was monophonic, meaning it consisted of a single melodic line without any accompanying harmony. Polyphony, or the combination of multiple melodic lines, emerged towards the end of the medieval period.</li>
              <li><b>Sacred and Secular Music</b>: Medieval music was predominantly religious, with a strong emphasis on sacred music composed for the Catholic Church. Gregorian chant, a form of monophonic plainchant, was a central component of sacred music. However, there was also secular music composed for entertainment and non-religious occasions.</li>
              <li><b>Vocal Dominance</b>: Singing was the primary means of musical expression during the medieval period. Instruments were used to accompany or embellish vocal performances rather than being standalone entities. Commonly used instruments included the organ, harp, lute, vielle (a precursor to the violin), and recorder.</li>
              <li><b>Lack of Notation</b>: In the early medieval period, there was no standardized system of musical notation. Music was primarily passed down through oral tradition, and composers relied on the memorization and transmission of melodies. Later in the medieval period, neumes (early notation symbols) and eventually early forms of staff notation were developed to notate pitch and rhythm.</li>
              <li><b>Modal Harmony</b>: While medieval music was primarily monophonic, when polyphony emerged, it was characterized by a type of harmony called "organum." Organum involved adding additional melodic lines, often in parallel or octaves, to an existing plainchant melody. The resulting harmonies were based on the modes and created a sense of vertical sonority.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Timeline</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>500-900</b>: This period is often referred to as the Early Medieval or the Dark Ages. During this time, music was predominantly monophonic, consisting of plainchant or Gregorian chant. The monastic centers played a vital role in preserving and developing this sacred music.</li>
              <li><b>900-1200</b>: This period marks the emergence of polyphony, particularly in the form of organum, which involved the addition of one or more voices to a pre-existing chant. The Notre Dame School in Paris, with composers like Léonin and Pérotin, was at the forefront of these developments. Measured rhythm and rhythmic modes were also introduced during this time.</li>
              <li><b>1100-1300</b>: This period witnessed the growth of secular music alongside sacred music. The troubadours (southern France) and trouvères (northern France) were important poet-musicians who composed and performed secular songs on topics such as courtly love and chivalry. This era also saw the rise of the Minnesang tradition in Germany, which encompassed courtly love songs and poetry.</li>
              <li><b>1300-1400</b>: This period, known as the Ars Nova, was characterized by significant developments in rhythm, notation, and musical expression. Composers like Guillaume de Machaut and Philippe de Vitry contributed to these advancements. The motet, a polyphonic vocal genre, gained popularity during this time.</li>
              <li><b>Late 1300s</b>: The musical style of the Ars Subtilior emerged during this period, characterized by complex rhythmic structures, intricate notation, and experimental compositional techniques. Composers such as Baude Cordier and Johannes Ciconia were associated with this style.</li>
              <li><b>Late 1400s</b>: The end of the medieval period saw a transitional phase known as the Renaissance. The musical style shifted towards a greater emphasis on humanism, with composers like Josquin des Prez bridging the gap between medieval and Renaissance music.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Forms</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Gregorian Chant:</b> Gregorian chant, also known as plainchant or plainsong, was the central form of sacred music in medieval Western Europe. It consists of monophonic melodies sung in Latin and was primarily used in liturgical settings within the Catholic Church. Gregorian chant is characterized by its free-flowing, non-metric rhythm and modal melodies.
              <br> -  "Dies Irae"</li>
              <li><b>Organum:</b> Organum was an early form of polyphony that emerged in the 9th century. It involved adding one or more melodic lines (often parallel or at a fixed interval) to an existing plainchant melody. The resulting harmonies created a sense of vertical sonority and were based on the modal system.
              <br> - "Viderunt Omnes" by Pérotin</li>
              <li><b>Motet:</b> The motet originated in the 13th century as a polyphonic vocal composition.

            </ul>

            <p>Medieval vs. Renaissance</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Polyphony vs. Monophony: One of the most significant differences is the shift from primarily monophonic music in the Medieval period to intricate polyphonic music in the Renaissance. Renaissance composers, such as Josquin des Prez and Palestrina, developed complex polyphonic textures with multiple melodic lines that harmonize together.</li>
              <li>Text Setting: In Medieval music, the focus was often on the sacred text and the expression of religious devotion. The music was primarily designed to enhance the meaning of the text. In the Renaissance, while text was still important, composers began to prioritize the musicality of the composition itself, aiming for balanced and beautiful musical structures.</li>
              <li>Secular Music: The Renaissance witnessed a rise in secular music and the development of new genres such as the madrigal and chanson. These secular forms explored themes of love, nature, and human experiences, expanding the musical repertoire beyond religious themes.</li>
              <li>Use of Modes: Medieval music was primarily based on the modal system, where specific scales or modes were used as the foundation for composition. The Renaissance period saw a gradual shift towards the use of tonality and the development of major and minor keys, which became the basis for harmonic progressions.</li>
              <li>Musical Notation: The Renaissance period saw advancements in musical notation, with the introduction of new symbols and techniques to represent rhythms and pitches more accurately. This allowed composers to write more complex and precise musical compositions.</li>
              <li>Rise of Instrumental Music: While instrumental music existed in the Medieval period, it was predominantly secondary to vocal music. In the Renaissance, instrumental music gained more prominence and independence. Composers such as Giovanni Gabrieli and William Byrd composed significant instrumental works.</li>

                <li>Basso Continuo: The Baroque period saw the development of the basso continuo, a bass line accompanied by harmonies indicated by figures (numbers). This allowed for greater flexibility and improvisation in the realization of the harmonies. In contrast, Renaissance music did not typically include a standardized basso continuo.</li>
                <li>Tonality: The Renaissance period was based on a modal system, with modes such as Dorian, Mixolydian, and Phrygian playing a prominent role. Baroque music, however, embraced a shift towards tonality, with major and minor keys serving as the foundation for harmonic progressions.</li>
                <li>Orchestra and Instrumentation: Baroque music saw the rise of larger ensembles and the development of the orchestra. Instruments such as the violin, harpsichord, and trumpet gained prominence and were featured as soloists. In the Renaissance, instrumental music existed but was often secondary to vocal music, with smaller ensembles and chamber music prevalent.</li>
                <li>Dynamics and Expression: Baroque music introduced a greater range of dynamics and expressive devices, including terraced dynamics (abrupt changes in volume) and detailed dynamic markings. Renaissance music, in contrast, relied more on the natural expressiveness of the vocal lines and text painting.</li>
                <li>Forms and Genres: Baroque music featured a wider range of standardized forms and genres, such as the concerto, suite, oratorio, and opera. Renaissance music, while also diverse in its forms, did not have the same level of standardization and development of specific genres.</li>

              <p>Characteristics</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Homophony emerged as a prominent texture in Baroque music, marking a shift from the predominantly polyphonic texture of the Renaissance period.</li>
                <li>Basso Continuo: The Baroque period introduced the concept of basso continuo, where a bass line (usually played by a cello or bassoon) is accompanied by a keyboard instrument (such as harpsichord or organ) and sometimes other instruments. The basso continuo provided a harmonic foundation and allowed for improvisation and embellishment within the given framework.</li>
                <li>Use of Figured Bass: Baroque music frequently includes a system of figured bass, where numerical figures are added below the bass line to indicate the desired harmonies. This allowed for flexibility and interpretation by the performer or the accompanying musician.</li>
                <li>Polyphony and Counterpoint: While homophonic textures became more prominent, Baroque music continued to place a strong emphasis on polyphony and intricate counterpoint. Multiple melodic lines interweave and interact, creating rich harmonies and complex musical relationships.</li>
                <li>Ornamentation: Baroque music is known for its elaborate ornamentation and embellishments. Performers were encouraged to add decorative elements such as trills, mordents, and turns to the written music, showcasing their virtuosity and expressive abilities.</li>
                <li>Emotional Expression: Baroque music seeks to evoke and express a wide range of emotions. Composers used harmonic progressions, melodic gestures, and expressive devices to convey specific moods, passions, and dramatic effects.</li>
                <li>Terraced Dynamics: Baroque music commonly employs terraced dynamics, where the volume abruptly shifts between loud and soft levels. Instead of gradual dynamic changes, the music often features distinct levels or "terraces" of volume.</li>
                <li>Orchestral and Chamber Music: Baroque music saw the development of larger orchestral ensembles, as well as smaller chamber groups. Composers utilized a variety of instruments, including strings, woodwinds, brass, and continuo instruments, to create diverse and colorful sounds.</li>

                Musical monody was developed by the Florentine Camerata in the 1580s to restore ancient Greek ideas of melody and declamation (probably with little historical accuracy). In part, it was a reaction against the complicated polyphony that dominated the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.

              <li>
                In monody one solo voice sings a melodic part, usually with considerable ornamentation, over a rhythmically independent bass line.
              </li>
              <li>
                Basso continuo, or figured bass, was played by an instrumentalist who was free to play any notes as long as they followed the harmonic figures written above the bass part.

Second, it includes a harmony-producing instrument, such as a small organ, a harpsichord, or a theorbo.

                From about the middle of the 17th century two distinct types of sonatas appeared: sonata da camera (chamber sonata) and sonata da chiesa (church sonata). Sonatas da chiesa ("church sonatas") usually consists of four movements, in the order slow–fast–slow–fast. Sonatas da camera ("chamber sonatas") often consisted of a prelude followed by a succession of dances. (After 1700, works comprising dance movements came to be called a variety of other names, such as partita, suite, ordre, ouverture, or air.)

                Based on the traditional pairing of dances in the Renaissance, the suite was the first multi-movement work for instruments. The suite was essentially a series of dances in the same key, most or all of them in two-part form. Johann Jakob Froberger is usually credited with establishing the classical suite (e.g., <a href="https://youtu.be/lw-ymM5NAMY" target="_blank"><u>Suite XII</u></a> for harpsichord).

                The opera sinfonia, or Italian overture, is often considered the direct forerunner of the three-movement symphony.
              </li>
              <li>
                By the 18th century, Alessandro Scarlatti (1660–1725) had helped standardize the opera sinfonia's structure of three contrasting movements: fast, slow, fast and dance-like. 
              </li>
              <li>
                The Italian composer Giovanni Battista Sammartini incorporated the fast-slow-fast movement structure in most of his symphonic works, and he started using an early version of sonata-form for his first movements.
              </li>
              <li>
               In the mid-1700s, Johann Stamitz, composer for the Mannheim Orchestra, began composing four-movement symphonies. He expanded the length of the sonata-form in the first movements and created greater contrast between the two themes (see, for example, his Symphony in E-flat op. 11 #3). 
              </li>
              <li>
                Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven further developed the four-movement pattern, starting with a movement in sonata form followed by a slower movement, a Minuet and a lively finale.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sonata form is in three parts - exposition, development, and recapitulation.
