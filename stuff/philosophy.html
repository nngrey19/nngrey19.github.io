              <div class="sans mt6 mb12">
                The Ionian school of Pre-Socratic philosophy was centered in Miletus, Ionia. It's members were material monists who sought to discover the underlying physical basis of everything. They are sometimes called cosmologists because they tried to explain the origin and development of the ordered world (the cosmos).
              </div>
              <p>
                Thales (c. 624 – 546 BCE). Considered the first philosopher in the Greek tradition. First person to offer a purely natural explanation for the origin of the world, free from mythological ingredients. He believed that everything was made of water.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anaximander (c. 610 – 546 BCE). Thales successor. Famous for the concept of apeiron ("the boundless"), something both infinite and indefinite. Hot and cold arose within the apeiron and began to struggle, producing the cosmos.

              <p>
                Anaximenes (c. 585 – 525 BCE). Anaximander’s successor. Believed that various types of matter arose out of air through condensation and rarefaction.

              <b class="sans">The Eleatic School</b>
              <div class="sans mt6 mb12">
                Spurned the empirical (observational) approach taken by earlier cosmologists. Advocated a metaphysical view of monism in response to the materialist monism advocated by the Ionian school.

              <p>
                Xenophanes of Colophon (c. 570 – 480 BCE). Criticized the anthropomorphism of the gods, saying that people made the gods in their own image. Advocated monotheism. Forerunner of the Eleatic school.
              </p>
              <p>
                Parmenides of Elea (c. 515 – 450 BCE). Founder of the Eleatics. “What is” cannot have come into being and cannot pass away because it would have to have come out of nothing or to become nothing, whereas nothing by its very nature does not exist.
              </p>
              <p>
                Zeno of Elea (c. 490 – 430 BCE). Known for his paradoxes. “First,” Aristotle says, “there is the argument about its being impossible to move because what moves must reach the half-way point earlier than the end” (Ph. 6.9, 239b11–13).

              <p>
                <b class="sans">Plato</b> (c. 427 – 347 BCE). Believed that the things people perceive with their senses are imperfect copies of eternal Forms. Knowledge is a process of remembering. In the myth of the cave (The Republic), Plato likened the ordinary person to a man sitting in a cave looking at a wall on which he sees nothing but the shadows of real things. Tripartite Soul - reason, desire, spirt (willpower or courage). Philosopher king - a philosophically aware class should govern socity.

              <div class="sans mt6 mb12">
                Zeno of Citium (c. 333 – 264 BCE). Founder of Stoicism. Believed the path to eudaimonia (happiness) is found in accepting the moment as it is, by not being controlled by the desire for pleasure or fear of pain, by doing one's part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.

                Scholasticism is a method of learning which emphasizes dialectical thinking (the exchange of thesis and antithesis in pursuit of a synthesis) and syllogistic or deductive reasoning (reasoning from one or more premises to reach a logically certain conclusion). It attempts to reconcile classical philosophy (particularly Aristotle) with Christian theology.

              <div class="sans mt6 mb12">
                The 16th and 17th centuries were the age of absolutism; the chief problem of politics was that of maintaining internal order. As such, the Renaissance political philosophies of Machiavelli and Hobbes had presupposed or defended the absolute power of kings and rulers.

              <b class="sans">The Scientific Revolution</b>
              <div class="sans mt6 mb12">
                The Scientific Revolution marked the emergence of modern science, when developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and chemistry transformed views of society. The publication of Nicolaus Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) in 1543 often cited as the beginning of the Scientific Revolution. Its end is marked by the "grand synthesis" of Isaac Newton's Principia in 1687.
              </div>
              <p>
                The adoption of the scientific method, popularized by Francis Bacon, was an important aspect of the Scientific Revolution. The scientific method requires abandoning preconceived assumptions and promotes the use of systematic experimentation, empirical observation and inductive reasoning (in contrast to the earlier, Aristotelian approach of deduction). (The premises of an inductive argument are viewed as supplying some evidence for the truth of a conclusion. The conclusion of an inductive argument is only probable, based upon the evidence given. The conclusion of a deductive argument is certain.)  
              </p>
              <b class="sans">Materialism, idealism, rationalism, and empiricism</b>
              <div class="sans mt6 mb12">
                Materialism, idealism, rationalism, and empiricism (both scientific empiricism and philosophical empiricism) are terms that are often discussed in conjunction.
              </div>
              <p>
                Materialism is a form of philosophical monism that holds that matter is the fundamental substance in nature, and that all things, including mental states and consciousness, are results of material interactions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Idealism asserts that reality is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. In contrast to materialism, idealism asserts that consciousness creates and determines material existence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rationalism is the belief that all knowledge arises from intellectual and deductive reason, rather than from the senses. Empiricism is the belief that the origin of all knowledge is sense experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Empiricism and rationalism are concerns of epistemology (does knowledge come from the senses or innately through reason?), while idealism and materialism belong to metaphysics (is the world made of matter or ideas?).
              </p>
              <b class="sans">Rationalism</b>
              <div class="sans mt6 mb12">

                Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716). Co-inventor of calculus.
              </p>
              <p>
                Descartes sought to ground natural science not in sensation and probability (as did Bacon) but in premises that could be known with absolute certainty:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    To employ the procedure of complete and systematic doubt to eliminate every belief that does not pass the test of indubitability.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To accept no idea as certain that is not clear, distinct, and free of contradiction.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To found all knowledge upon the bedrock certainty of self-consciousness, so that “I think, therefore I am” becomes the only innate idea unshakable by doubt.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                From the indubitability of the self, Descartes inferred the existence of a perfect God; and, from the fact that a perfect being is incapable of falsification or deception, he concluded that the ideas about the physical world that God has implanted in human beings must be true.
              </p>
              <p>
                Descartes saw the human body as a kind of machine that follows the mechanical laws of physics, while the mind (or consciousness) was a separate entity, not subject to the laws of physics. This dualism (Cartesian dualism) is sometimes referred to as the mind–body problem in philosophy.
              </p>
              <p>
               Spinoza rejected Descartes' dualism in favor of a kind of monism where mind and body were just two different aspects of a single underlying substance which might be called Nature (and which he also equated with a God of infinitely many attributes, effectively a kind of Pantheism).
              </p>
              <p>
                (The term "monism" was introduced in the 18th century by Christian von Wolff to describe philosophical thought that attempted to eliminate the dichotomy of body and mind and explain all phenomena as manifestations of a single substance. Thereafter the term was more broadly used for any theory postulating a unifying principle.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Leibniz’s pluralism contrasted with Descartes’s dualism and Spinoza’s monism. According to Leibniz, the real world is composed of eternal, non-material and mutually-independent elements he called monads, and the material world that we see and touch is actually just phenomena (appearances or by-products of the underlying real world).

                In the natural sciences, empiricism is associated with the scientific method and states that "knowledge is based on experience" and that "knowledge is tentative and probabilistic, subject to continued revision and falsification" (Shelley). Sir Francis Bacon was the leading figure of Renaissance empiricism.

                Philosophical empiricists hold no knowledge to be properly inferred or deduced unless it is derived from one's sense-based experience. John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume were the primary exponents of empiricism during the 18th century Enlightenment. They are the leading figures of the philosophical movement known as British empiricism.
              </p>
              <p>
                In "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding," John Locke proposed that the only knowledge humans can have is a posteriori, i.e., based upon experience. Locke, like Avicenna before him, believed that the mind was a tabula rasa (or blank slate). Locke believed:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    That the ultimate source of human ideas is sense experience.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    That all mental operations are a combining and compounding of simple sensory materials into complex conceptual entities.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Locke also made a distinction between “primary qualities” (such as solidity, figure, extension, motion, and rest), which are real properties of physical objects, and “secondary qualities” (such as color, taste, and smell), which are effects of the mind.
              </p>
              <p>
                George Berkeley argued that things only exist either as a result of their being perceived, or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving. An object only really exists if someone is there to see or sense it ("to be is to be perceived"), although, he added, the infinite mind of God perceives everything all the time, and so in this respect the objects continue to exist.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hume argued that, although we may form beliefs and make inductive inferences about things outside our experience (by means of instinct, imagination and custom), they cannot be conclusively established by reason and we should not make any claims to certain knowledge about them (a hard-line attitude verging on complete Skepticism). For example, he argued that our belief in the power of cause and effect is not justified by either observation or by logical deduction. We only ever see one thing following another: we never observe any power that makes one thing necessitate an effect.

                Although the terms Middle Ages and Renaissance were not invented until well after the historical periods they designate, scholars of the 18th century called their age “the Enlightenment” with self-conscious enthusiasm and pride.
              </p>
              <p>
                The 18th century was the age of the democratic revolutions, and the Enlightenment theories of Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau championed the freedom and equality of citizens. The germ of modern liberalism is found in these two theorists: faith in representative democracy, in civil liberties, and in the basic dignity of human beings.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Enlightenment emerged from Renaissance humanism. It viewed reason and the evidence of the senses as the primary sources of knowledge and drew inspiration from the Scientific Revolution. Enlightenment thinkers also advanced ideals such as liberty, progress, toleration, fraternity, constitutional government and separation of church and state. They believed that the tremendous intellectual and scientific progress of the age would dramatically improve human society.

              <b class="sans">Immanuel Kant</b> (1724–1804)
              <div class="sans mt6 mb12">
                Attempted to combine those two apparently contradictory doctrines of Rationalism and Empiricism into one overarching system.
              </div>
              <p>
                Kant claims that we know more than Berkeley's ideas in our minds, in that we also directly know of at least the possibility of "noumena" ("things-in-themselves"), even if they cannot be directly and immediately known.
              </p>
              <p>
                The human self constructs knowledge out of sense impressions and from universal concepts called categories that it imposes upon them. Ideas, the raw matter of knowledge, must somehow be due to realities existing independently of human minds; but he held that such things-in-themselves must remain forever unknown. Human knowledge cannot reach to them because knowledge can only arise in the course of synthesizing the ideas of sense.
              </p>
              <p>
                We grasp reality and make sense of the world through several categories of thought: quantity (unity, plurality, totality); quality (reality, negation, limitation); relation (substance, cause, community) and modality (possibility, existence, necessity). These categories are not so much read out of experience as read into it and, hence, are a priori, or pure, as opposed to empirical. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Knowledge must rest on judgments that are 1) a priori (from reason alone, as in Rationalism) and yet also 2) synthetic (a posteriori knowledge from experience alone, as in Empiricism), so that the predicate term contains something more than is analytically contained in the subject. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, for example, the proposition that all bodies are extended is not synthetic but analytic because the notion of extension is contained in the very notion of body, whereas the proposition that all bodies are heavy is synthetic because weight supposes, in addition to the notion of body, that of bodies in relation to one another. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Kant's contributions to ethics include his concept of the categorical imperative, a moral law that is absolute for all agents and does not depend on any ulterior motive. “Thou shalt not steal,” for example, is categorical as distinct from hypothetical imperatives, such as "Do not steal if you want to be popular." Kant offered several formulations of the categorical imperative, including "So act as to treat humanity, whether in your own person or in another, always as an end, and never as only a means."

              </p>
              <p>
                Earlier "idealists" maintained that reality is ultimately intellectual rather than material (Plato) or that the existence of objects is mind-dependent (Berkeley).
              </p>
              <p>
                Kant’s transcendental idealism claimed that the objects of human cognition are appearances and not things-in-themselves. Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel radicalized this view, transforming Kant’s transcendental idealism into absolute idealism, which holds that things-in-themselves are a contradiction in terms, because a thing must be an object of our consciousness if it is to be an object at all.
              </p>
              <p>
                Johann Fichte believed that there can be no thing-in-itself, because a thing is only a thing when it is something for us. Even the thing in itself is, in fact, a product of our own conscious thought.
              </p>
              <p>
                Friedrich Schelling maintained that the "I" needs the Not-I, because there is no subject without object, and vice versa. The existence of the I precedes all thinking (I must exist in order to think) and thinking determines all being (A thing is nothing other than an object of thought).
              </p>
              <p>
                Hegel advocated a kind of historically-minded absolute idealism, in which the universe would realize its spiritual potential through the development of human society, and in which mind and nature can be seen as two abstractions of one indivisible whole Spirit.
              </p>
              <p>
                The fundamental notion of Hegel's dialectic is that things or ideas have internal contradictions. These contradictions lead to the dissolution of the thing or idea in the simple form to a higher-level, more complex thing or idea, which has its own internal contradictions. 
              </p>
              <p>
                This process would continue effectively ad infinitum, until reaching the ultimate synthesis, which is what Hegel called the Absolute Idea.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hegel saw history as a progression, always moving forward, never static, in which each successive movement emerges as a solution to the contradictions inherent in the preceding movement.

              <p>
                Existentialism is a reaction against traditional philosophies, such as Rationalism, Empiricism and Positivism, that seek to discover an ultimate order and universal meaning. It is the view that humans define their own meaning in life, and try to make rational decisions despite existing in an irrational universe. The only way to rise above the essentially absurd conditions of life is by exercising our personal freedom and choice. Existence is prior to essence (essence is the meaning that may be ascribed to life). As Sartre put it: "At first [Man] is nothing. Only afterward will he be something, and he himself will have made what he will be."

                Analytic Philosophy is used as a catch-all phrase to include (mainly Anglophone) branches of contemporary philosophy, such as Logical Positivism and Ordinary Language Philosophy.  It is often understood in contrast to other philosophical traditions, most notably continental philosophies such as existentialism, phenomenology, and Hegelianism.

They turned away from then-dominant forms of Hegelianism, (particularly objecting to its Idealism and its almost deliberate obscurity). For many Analytic Philosophers, language is the principal (perhaps the only) tool, and philosophy consists in clarifying how language can be used.
