              <b class="sans">The Ionians</b>
              <div class="sans mt6 mb12">
                The Ionian school of Pre-Socratic philosophy was centered in Miletus, Ionia. Thales, Anaximander and Anaximenes were material monists who sought to discover the underlying physical basis of everything. They are sometimes called cosmologists because they tried to explain the origin and development of the ordered world (the cosmos).
              </div>
              <p>
                Thales (c. 624 – 546 BCE). Considered the first philosopher in the Greek tradition. He was the first person to offer a purely natural explanation for the origin of the world, free from mythological ingredients. He believed that everything was made of water.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anaximander (c. 610 – 546 BCE). Thales successor. Famous for the concept of apeiron ("the boundless"), something both infinite and indefinite. Hot and cold arose within the apeiron and began to struggle, producing the cosmos.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anaximenes (c. 585 – 525 BCE). Anaximander’s successor. Believed that various types of matter arose out of air through condensation and rarefaction.

              <b class="sans">The Eleatic School</b>
              <div class="sans mt6 mb12">
                Spurned the empirical (observational) approach taken by earlier cosmologists. Advocated a metaphysical view of monism in response to the materialist monism advocated by the Ionian school.

              <p>
                Xenophanes of Colophon (c. 570 – 480 BCE). Criticized the popular notions of the gods, saying that people made the gods in their own image. Advocated monotheism. Forerunner of the Eleatic school.
              </p>
              <p>
                Parmenides of Elea (c. 515 – 450 BCE). Founder of the Eleatics. “What is” cannot have come into being and cannot pass away because it would have to have come out of nothing or to become nothing, whereas nothing by its very nature does not exist.
              </p>
              <p>
                Zeno of Elea (c. 490 – 430 BCE). Known for his paradoxes. “First,” Aristotle says, “there is the argument about its being impossible to move because what moves must reach the half-way point earlier than the end” (Ph. 6.9, 239b11–13).

              <b class="sans">Aristotle</b>
              <div class="sans mt6 mb12">
                Aristotle (c. 384 – 322 BCE). Invented the discipline of logic. “The Organon” (Latin for “instrument”) is a series of Aristotle’s works on logic (what he himself would call analytics). He is also the first author whose surviving works contain detailed and extensive observations of natural phenomena. Unlike Plato, Aristotle held that Form and Matter were inseparable, and cannot exist apart from each other.
              </div>
              <p>
                The Prior Analytics is devoted to the theory of the syllogism: Every Greek is human. Every human is mortal. Therefore, every Greek is mortal.

              <p>
                In Posterior Analytics Aristotle applies the syllogism to scientific ends. Scientific knowledge must be built from demonstrations. A demonstration is a particular kind of syllogism, one whose premises can be traced back to principles that are true, necessary, universal, and immediately intuited.

              Early Political Philosophy
              The 16th and 17th centuries were the age of absolutism; the chief problem of politics was that of maintaining internal order. As such, the Renaissance political philosophies of Machiavelli, Bodin, and Hobbes had presupposed or defended the absolute power of kings and rulers.

              Niccolo Machiavelli. The rise of secular power during the Renaissance stimulated the growth of political philosophy. Explored techniques for the seizure and retention of power.

              Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679). In the “state of nature” that preceded civilization, “every man’s hand [was] raised against every other” and human life was accordingly “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” A social contract was thus agreed upon to convey all private rights to a single sovereign in return for general protection and the institution of a reign of law.

              The Scientific Revolution
              The Scientific Revolution marked the emergence of modern science, when developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and chemistry transformed views of society. The publication of Nicolaus Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) in 1543 often cited as the beginning of the Scientific Revolution. Its end is marked by the "grand synthesis" of Isaac Newton's Principia in 1687.

              The adoption of the scientific method, popularized by Francis Bacon, was an important aspect of the Scientific Revolution. The scientific method requires abandoning preconceived assumptions and promotes the use of systematic experimentation, empirical observation and inductive reasoning (in contrast to the earlier, Aristotelian approach of deduction). (The premises of an inductive argument are viewed as supplying some evidence for the truth of a conclusion. The conclusion of an inductive argument is only probable, based upon the evidence given. The conclusion of a deductive argument is certain.)  

              Materialism, idealism, rationalism, and empiricism
              Materialism, idealism, rationalism, and empiricism (both scientific empiricism and philosophical empiricism) are terms that are often discussed in conjunction.

              Materialism is a form of philosophical monism that holds that matter is the fundamental substance in nature, and that all things, including mental states and consciousness, are results of material interactions.

              Idealism asserts that reality is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. In contrast to materialism, idealism asserts that consciousness creates and determines material existence.

              Empiricism and rationalism are concerns of epistemology (does knowledge come from the senses or innately through reason?), while idealism and materialism belong to metaphysics (is the world made of matter or ideas?).

              Rationalism
              René Descartes (1596–1650). Heliocentrism, mind-body dualism, rationalism.
              Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677). Rationalism.
              Nicolas Malebranche (1638–1715). Cartesian.
              Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716). Co-inventor of calculus.

              Empiricism is commonly contrasted with rationalism, which holds that the mind may apprehend some truths directly, without requiring the medium of the senses. Descartes, Leibniz and Spinoza are the leading rationalists (the Continental Rationalists) of the Enlightenment.

              Descartes sought to ground natural science not in sensation and probability (as did Bacon) but in premises that could be known with absolute certainty:

                  To employ the procedure of complete and systematic doubt to eliminate every belief that does not pass the test of indubitability.
                  To accept no idea as certain that is not clear, distinct, and free of contradiction.
                  To found all knowledge upon the bedrock certainty of self-consciousness, so that “I think, therefore I am” becomes the only innate idea unshakable by doubt.

              From the indubitability of the self, Descartes inferred the existence of a perfect God; and, from the fact that a perfect being is incapable of falsification or deception, he concluded that the ideas about the physical world that God has implanted in human beings must be true.

              Cartesian philosophy accepted the doctrines of Renaissance science while attempting to ground them in medieval notions of God and the human mind. Thus, a certain dualism between God the Creator and the mechanistic world of his creation, between mind as a spiritual principle and matter (or body) as spatial extension, was inherent in the Cartesian position (Cartesian dualism). This dualism is sometimes referred to as the mind–body problem in philosophy.

              The term "monism" was introduced in the 18th century by Christian von Wolff to describe philosophical thought that attempted to eliminate the dichotomy of body and mind and explain all phenomena as manifestations of a single substance. Thereafter the term was more broadly used for any theory postulating a unifying principle.

              The tradition of rationalism was carried on by Benedict de Spinoza and his younger contemporary Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Spinoza conceived of the universe pantheistically as a single infinite substance, which he called “God,” with the dual attributes of thought and extension.

              Leibniz’s pluralism contrasted with Descartes’s dualism and Spinoza’s monism. Leibniz posited the existence of an infinite number of spiritual substances, which he called "monads".

              In the "Principles of Nature and of Grace Founded in Reason", Leibniz stated a maxim that could fairly represent the entire school: "True reasoning depends upon necessary or eternal truths, such as those of logic, numbers, geometry, which establish an indubitable connection of ideas and unfailing consequences.”

              Empiricism
              Francis Bacon (1561–1626). Empiricist.
              John Locke (1632–1704). Major Empiricist. Political philosopher.
              George Berkeley (1685–1753). Idealist, empiricist.
              David Hume (1711–1776). Empiricist, skeptic.

              In the natural sciences, empiricism is associated with the scientific method and states that "knowledge is based on experience" and that "knowledge is tentative and probabilistic, subject to continued revision and falsification" (Shelley). Sir Francis Bacon was the leading figure of Renaissance empiricism.

              Philosophical empiricists hold no knowledge to be properly inferred or deduced unless it is derived from one's sense-based experience. John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume were the primary exponents of empiricism during the 18th century Enlightenment. They are the leading figures of the philosophical movement known as British empiricism.

              In "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding," John Locke proposed that the only knowledge humans can have is a posteriori, i.e., based upon experience. He said the human mind is a tabula rasa, a "blank slate." Locke believed:

                  That the ultimate source of human ideas is sense experience.
                  That all mental operations are a combining and compounding of simple sensory materials into complex conceptual entities.

              Locke also made a distinction between “primary qualities” (such as solidity, figure, extension, motion, and rest), which are real properties of physical objects, and “secondary qualities” (such as color, taste, and smell), which are effects of the mind.

              George Berkeley argued that things only exist either as a result of their being perceived, or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving. He rejected the distinction between primary and secondary qualities and claimed that a physical object are no more than bundles of sense data in the perceiver (phenomenalism).

              David Hume argued that our belief in the power of cause and effect is not justified by either observation or by logical deduction. We only ever see one thing following another: we never observe any power that makes one thing necessitate an effect. Even if we could be satisfied that we had established x caused y, logic can’t establish any general principle of causation, since all the regularities we have observed in nature were in the past, but the principle of cause and effect is assumed to apply in the present and future. Logically, you can never arrive at a truth about the future based entirely on premises that concern the past. 

              The Enlightenment
              Baron de Montesquieu (1689–1755). Skeptic, humanist.
              Jean–Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778). Social contract political philosopher.
              Voltaire (1694–1778). Advocate for freedoms of religion and expression.

              Although the terms Middle Ages and Renaissance were not invented until well after the historical periods they designate, scholars of the 18th century called their age “the Enlightenment” with self-conscious enthusiasm and pride.

              The 18th century was the age of the democratic revolutions, and the Enlightenment theories of Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau championed the freedom and equality of citizens. The germ of modern liberalism is found in these two theorists: faith in representative democracy, in civil liberties, and in the basic dignity of human beings.

              The Enlightenment emerged from Renaissance humanism. It viewed reason and the evidence of the senses as the primary sources of knowledge and drew inspiration from the Scientific Revolution. Enlightenment thinkers also advanced ideals such as liberty, progress, toleration, fraternity, constitutional government and separation of church and state. They believed that the tremendous intellectual and scientific progress of the age would dramatically improve human society.

              Immanuel Kant (1724–1804). Major contributions in nearly every field of philosophy, especially metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.

              Immanuel Kant marks the culmination of the philosophy of the Enlightenment. Kant’s great contribution was to elucidate both the sensory and the a priori elements in knowledge and thus to bridge the gap between the extreme rationalism of Leibniz and the extreme empiricism of Hume.
              Kant believed that objects must conform to the human apparatus of knowing rather than that human knowledge must conform to objects (transcendental idealism). The question then became: What is the exact nature of this knowing apparatus?
              As Kant saw it, the problem of metaphysics is to explain how, on the one hand, its principles can be necessary and universal (such being a condition for any knowledge that is scientific) and yet, on the other hand, involve also a knowledge of the real and so provide the investigator with the possibility of more knowledge than is analytically contained in what he already knows—i.e., than is implicit in the meaning alone. To meet these two conditions, Kant maintained, knowledge must rest on judgments that are 1) a priori, for it is only as they are separate from the contingencies of experience that they could be necessary and yet also 2) synthetic—i.e., so that the predicate term contains something more than is analytically contained in the subject. Thus, for example, the proposition that all bodies are extended is not synthetic but analytic because the notion of extension is contained in the very notion of body, whereas the proposition that all bodies are heavy is synthetic because weight supposes, in addition to the notion of body, that of bodies in relation to one another. Hence, the basic problem, as Kant formulated it, is to determine “How [i.e., under what conditions] are synthetic a priori judgments possible?”
              Kant maintained that physics is a priori and synthetic because in its ordering of experience it uses concepts of a special sort. These concepts — “categories,” he called them — are not so much read out of experience as read into it and, hence, are a priori, or pure, as opposed to empirical. But they differ from empirical concepts in something more than their origin: their whole role in knowledge is different. For, whereas empirical concepts serve to correlate particular experiences and so to bring out in a detailed way how experience is ordered, the categories have the function of prescribing the general form that this detailed order must take. They belong, as it were, to the very framework of knowledge. But although they are indispensable for objective knowledge, the sole knowledge that the categories can yield is of objects of possible experience; they yield valid and real knowledge only when they are ordering what is given through sense in space and time.
              Kant's contributions to ethics include his concept of the categorical imperative, a moral law that is absolute for all agents and does not depend on any ulterior motive. “Thou shalt not steal,” for example, is categorical as distinct from hypothetical imperatives, such as "Do not steal if you want to be popular." Kant offered several formulations of the categorical imperative, including "So act as to treat humanity, whether in your own person or in another, always as an end, and never as only a means."
              German Idealism
              Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814).
              G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831). German idealist.
              F. W. J. von Schelling (1775–1854). German idealist.

              Subjective idealism argues that only minds and mental contents exist. This form of idealism is "subjective" because it asserts that reality is dependent upon the minds of the subjects that perceive it.
              Objective idealism postulates that there is only one perceiver, and that this perceiver is one with that which is perceived. There is an objective consciousness which exists before and, in some sense, independently of human ones. The absolute idealism of Hegel and others is a form of objective idealism.
              While earlier "idealists" maintained that reality is ultimately intellectual rather than material (Plato) or that the existence of objects is mind-dependent (Berkeley), the German idealists reject the distinctions these views presuppose.
              Kant’s holds that the objects of human cognition are transcendentally ideal and empirically real. They are transcendentally ideal, because the conditions of the cognition human beings have of objects are to be found in the cognitive faculties of human beings.
              The primary representatives of absolute idealism were Johann Fichte, Friedrich Schelling, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.
              Johann Fichte believed that there can be no thing in itself, because a thing is only a thing when it is something for us. Even the thing in itself is, in fact, a product of our own conscious thought, meaning the thing in itself is nothing other a postulation of our own consciousness.
              Friedrich Schelling maintained that the I is the unconditioned condition of both being and thinking. The existence of the I precedes all thinking (I must exist in order to think) and thinking determines all being (A thing is nothing other than an object of thought).
              Hegel believed that for the thinking subject (human reason or consciousness) to be able to know its object (the world) at all, there must be in some sense an identity of thought and being. He stated that "the rational is the real" and that "the truth is the whole". He further argued that this "absolute" or "whole" is not static but develops over time. Hegel called this evolution "the dialectical process”.


              Utilitarianism
              Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832). Utilitarian, hedonist.
              James Mill (1773–1836). Utilitarian.

              John Stuart Mill social theory was an attempt to combat the evils of the Industrial Revolution. His ethics, expressed in Utilitarianism (1861), built on the formulations of Jeremy Bentham. Mill believed the purpose of society was to produce the greatest quantity of happiness for its members.

              Marxists
              Ludwig Feuerbach (1804–1872).
              Karl Marx (1818–1883). Socialist, formulated historical materialism.
              Friedrich Engels (1820–1895). Egalitarian, dialectical materialist.

              A radical counterbalance to Mill’s liberal ideas was provided by Karl Marx. Marx believed that society is a moving balance (dialectic) of antithetical forces that produce social change.

              Exitentialism
              Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860). Pessimism, Critic, Absurdist.
              Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855). Existentialist.
              Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900). Naturalistic philosopher, influence on Existentialism.

              Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980). Humanism, existentialism.
              Karl Jaspers (1883–1969). Existentialist.

              Meanwhile, he philosophy of Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche placed an emphasis on the irrational. They viewed the mind as dark, obscure, hidden, and deep.

              Pragmaticsm
              Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914). Pragmatist.
              William James (1842–1910). Pragmatism, Radical empiricism.
              John Dewey (1859–1952). Pragmatism.

              In America, there was a strong reaction against idealism fostered the pragmatic movement, led by Charles Sanders Peirce and William James. Peirce held that the function of all inquiry is to eradicate doubt and that the meaning of a concept consists of its practical consequences.

              Sigmund Freud (1856–1939). Neurologist, founded psychoanalysis, posited structural model of mind.

              Phenomenology
              Edmund Husserl (1859–1938). Founder of phenomenology.
              Martin Heidegger (1889–1976). Phenomenologist.
              Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908–1961). Influential French phenomenologist.

              Positivism 
              Auguste Comte (1798–1857) Maintained the empirical tradition through his philosophy of science (positivism), which maintained that valid knowledge was derived through the accepted methods of science.

              Analytic Philosophy
              Gottlob Frege (1848–1925). Influential analytic philosopher.
              Bertrand Russell (1872–1970). Analytic philosopher, nontheist, influential.
              Alfred North Whitehead
              G. E. Moore (1873–1958). Common sense theorist, ethical non–naturalist.
              Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951). Analytic philosopher, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, influential.

              Analytic Philosophy is used as a catch-all phrase to include (mainly Anglophone) branches of contemporary philosophy, such as Logical Positivism and Ordinary Language Philosophy.  It is often understood in contrast to other philosophical traditions, most notably continental philosophies such as existentialism, phenomenology, and Hegelianism.

              Analytic Philosophy as a specific movement was led by Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, G. E. Moore and Ludwig Wittgenstein. They turned away from then-dominant forms of Hegelianism, (particularly objecting to its Idealism and its almost deliberate obscurity). For many Analytic Philosophers, language is the principal (perhaps the only) tool, and philosophy consists in clarifying how language can be used.

              Logical Positivism / Logical Empiricism / Vienna Circle
              Ernst Mach (1838–1916). Philosopher of science, influence on logical positivism.
              Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951). Analytic philosopher, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, influential.
              Moritz Schlick (1882–1936). Founder of Vienna Circle, logical positivism.

              The most important early figures in Logical Positivism were the Bohemian-Austrian Positivist philosopher Ernst Mach (1838 - 1916) and the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein (especially his "Tractatus" of 1921, a text of great importance for Logical Positivists).

              A statement is meaningful only if it is either purely formal (essentially, mathematics and logic) or capable of empirical verification.

              This effectively resulted in an almost complete rejection of Metaphysics (and to a large extent Ethics) on the grounds that it is unverifiable. 

              The Vienna Circle met under the (nominal) leadership of Moritz Schlick from 1924 to 1936

              Western Marxism
              There were two main forms of Marxism in the West: that of the traditional communist parties and what came to be known as Western Marxism. Western Marxists were concerned less with the actual political or economic practice of Marxism than with its philosophical interpretation, especially in relation to cultural and historical studies.
              Prominent figures in the evolution of Western Marxism included the central Europeans György Lukács, Karl Korsch, and Lucien Goldmann; Antonio Gramsci of Italy; the German theorists who constituted the Frankfurt School, especially Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, and Jürgen Habermas; and Henri Lefebvre, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty of France.
