        through Machaut)</b></font><br>
        <br>
        Western classical music history is traditionally understood as beginning 
        with plainchant (also called "Gregorian" chant), the vocal religious practice 
        of the Roman Catholic Church. Plainchant was transmitted by memory until 
        the early 9th century, when the Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne arranged 
        for it to be notated, and for standardized plainchant books to be distributed 
        to churches and monasteries across Europe. Limited in pitch range and 
        monophonic (i.e., composed of a single melody with no accompaniment), 
        plainchant was sung largely by monks, nuns, and clerics rather than by 
        professional singers. Plainchant was sung in the Divine Offices, eight 
        daily prayer services using Old Testament texts, and in the Mass, a midmorning 
        celebration of the life and death of Jesus Christ. The Alleluia reproduced 
        here was a chant of jubilation ("Alleluia" = "Hallelujah"), sung as part 
        of the Mass.<br>

        <br>
        The earliest major repertory of Western secular (non-religious) music 
        which has come down to us is that of the troubadors and trouveres, French 
        poet-musicians of the Middle Ages who set their own poems to music. The 
        majority of the resulting songs were about love, often the fictionalized, 
        abstracted "courtly love" of a male character for a noblewoman above his 
        social level. Because troubador songs were notated as simple rows of pitches 
        without rhythm, the rhythms and instrumental accompaniments of modern 
        performances are based on conjecture; images of troubadors in medieval 
        manuscripts have offered hints as to what instruments were played. Bernart 
        de Ventadorn (c. 1140- c. 1200) was one of the greatest of the troubadors. 
        His "La douza votz," written in the now-extinct language Provencal, deals 
        with the singer's rejection by the lady whom he has long served.<br>

        <br>
        <br>
        In the 10th and 11th centuries, composers began setting sacred texts polyphonically 
        (i.e., with more than one melody at the same time). Leonin (c. 1135- c. 
        1200) wrote polyphonic settings of the texts sung on the most important 
        occasions of the Christian year, such as Christmas and Easter. He did 
        this by greatly slowing down an existing plainchant, and adding to it 
        a new, more rapidly flowing musical line at a higher pitch. This technique 
        was called organum; the slowed-down plainchant was called the tenor. Some 
        sections of Leonin's polyphony were sped up and rhythmicized; later composers 
        added the words of devotional poems to Leonin's notes. This example uses 
        the <i>Alleluia pascha nostrum</i> plainchant as its tenor; it was sung 
        as part of Easter services at the spectacular Gothic cathedral Notre Dame 
        of Paris.<br>

        <br>
        Evidence suggests that the compositions of Perotin (active c. 1200), like 
        those of Leonin, were sung at Notre Dame of Paris. Many of Perotin's organa 
        (pl. organum) included two or, as in this example, three active musical 
        lines above the tenor. Perotin slowed down the tenor to an incredible 
        degree--in this example, it takes the tenor four minutes to sing the two 
        words "Viderunt omnes"! <i>Viderunt omnes</i> is a gradual, a joyful text 
        sung in response to a New Testament reading during Mass It was sung on 
        Christmas Day.<br>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the 13th century, rhythmic 
        passages of organum to which words had been added (such as the passage 
        in the middle of the Leonin organum above) began to be treated as standalone 
        musical works called motets (literally, "worded"). Soon, three-part motets 
        appeared, with a different text sung in each voice. (Sometimes the texts 
        were in different languages!) Composers came to use for tenors secular 
        French songs as well as passages of plainchant. One such composer was 
        Guillaume de Machaut (c. 1300-1377), who was not only a musician of great 
        renown but also a poet whose stature approached that of Chaucer. The following 
        motet is based on a secular tenor; each of its three voices sings a different 
        French love poem.<br>

        The tradition of the motet continued into the 15th century. Guillaume 
        Dufay (c. 1400-1474), the most renowned composer of his time, composed 
        grand motets for ceremonial occasions in early Renaissance Italy. <i>Nuper 
        rosarum flores</i> commemorates the dedication of the cathedral Santa 
        Maria del Fiore in Florence in 1436. Dufay owed his rich sound to harmonic 
        techniques brought from England by his contemporary John Dunstable.<br>

        The Renaissance's grandest, most highly valued works of vocal music were 
        polyphonic settings of the Ordinary of the Mass. The Ordinary is composed 
        of five texts--Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei (the first 
        words of the texts)--that were included in every Mass, not only in Masses 
        that celebrated special occasions. Each text was set as a separate movement. 
        Often, each movement began with a similar melody, in which case the Mass 
        was called "cyclic"; when that melody was taken from plainchant or from 
        a secular song, the Mass was called a "parody Mass" ("parody" meant in 
        the sense of imitation, but not humorously). The most famous mass of Josquin 
        des Pres (1440-1521) was that parodying the plainchant beginning with 
        the text "Pangue lingua." By Josquin's time, the slow-moving tenors of 
        the Medieval era had been replaced by lower voices that moved as quickly 
        as the higher voices; the vocal ranges specified for the various singers 
        were equivalent to our soprano, alto, tenor, and bass.<br>

        <br>
        From about 1530 to 1600, the pre-eminent form of secular vocal music in 
        Europe was the madrigal. The madrigal typically set a poem in Italian 
        (later, often in English) with an intense emotional cast. The setting 
        was usually for four or five voices with no instrumental accompaniment, 
        although instruments were probably added in performance at times. Jacques 
        Arcadelt (c. 1500-1568) was a Frenchman, but wrote madrigals in the Italian 
        city of Florence. The most famous example of his work is <i>Il bianco 
        e dolce cigno</i>.<br>

        <br>
        Toward the end of the 16th century, madrigals became more tortuous harmonically 
        and more aggressive in their use of musical devices to project the text's 
        meaning and character. Luca Marenzio (1553-1599) was the most celebrated 
        "madrigalist" of his day.<br>

        <br>
        The instrumental music of the Renaissance largely fell into two categories: 
        transcriptions of vocal music, and dance music. Different dance styles 
        corresponded to different underlying musical rhythms (as with today's 
        Latin dance music). The German Michael Praetorius (1571?-1621) composed 
        a large set of dances entitled "Terpsichore," after the Greek Muse of 
        dance. A group of brief "voltes" is reproduced here; the volte was a dance 
        from Southwest France in which the woman leapt high in the air ("volte" 
        = vault). Praetorius gave no indication of what instruments were to be 
        used--his dances were played by whatever instruments were available. Here, 
        the Early Music Consort of London switches between four different "consorts" 
        of instruments, one per volte, before all four consorts play the end of 
        the fourth volte together. A consort was a set of instruments similar 
        in design and tone but varied in size and pitch.<br>

        J. S. Bach) </b></font><br>
        <br>
        The Baroque era of Western classical music is usually defined as the period 
        from 1600 to 1750. (These dates are, of course, rough; the Renaissance 
        dances of Praetorius were written in 1612.) Two stylistic tendencies that 
        partially define the Baroque were an increased interest in the solo voice 
        and a rise in the status of instruments and instrumental music.<br>
        <br>
        The first of these tendencies was born in Florence, among a group of musicians 
        and philosophers called the Florentine Camerata ("camerata" = chamber, 
        as in a "chamber of commerce"). The members of the Camerata sought to 
        create a form of stage music comparable in expressive power to ancient 
        Greek tragedy. They disparaged the polyphonic madrigal, creating instead 
        a new form--the opera--in which soloists sang against an instrumental 
        background. The earliest opera that has entirely survived is <i>L'Euridice</i>, 
        by the Camerata member Jacopo Peri (1561-1633). <i>L'Euridice</i> presents 
        the legend of Orpheus and Eurydice, altered so that Orpheus successfully 
        retrieves Eurydice from the underworld in a happy ending.<br>

        <br>
        The showpiece of opera came to be the aria, a self-contained, melodious 
        passage that revealed the mood or attitude of the character singing it. 
        The arias in a given opera were separated by recitative, a faster-moving, 
        more speechlike form of singing. Henry Purcell (1659-1695) wrote <i>Dido 
        and Aeneas</i> to be performed by the students at a girls' school. <br>

        <br>
        The tradition of religious polyphonic vocal music continued in the Baroque 
        era. Martin Luther, the author of the Reformation, was also a musician; 
        in the 16th century, he collected hundreds of tunes to serve as devotional 
        hymns for his new Protestant Church. In the 18th century, German composers 
        created cantatas ("cantata"=sung), multi-movement works that elaborated 
        on Luther's hymns. The cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) included 
        both chorales and aria-like solos. The chorale "Wachet auf" is among Bach's 
        most famous. Unlike the choral music of the Renaissance, "Wachet auf" 
        included parts written for instruments.<br>

        <br>
        The oratorio shared the cantata's form on a larger scale. While most (but 
        not all) German cantatas were religious works written for the church, 
        oratorios could be written on secular topics and performed in secular 
        settings. The <i>Messiah</i>, by George Friedrich Handel (1685-1759), 
        was performed in concert halls, but treated a sacred subject: the life 
        of Jesus Christ, with devotional passages interspersed. (Some complained 
        at the time that such a religious work was out of place in the concert 
        hall.) Here is the chorus "All we like sheep have gone astray"--allegorically 
        astray from the righteousness of Jesus and the New Testament God.<br>

        <br>
        In their new focus on instrumental music, Baroque musicians valued no 
        instrument more highly than the violin. They believed the violin's tone 
        to have expressive powers akin to those of the voice. Violins were the 
        melodic leaders of the trio sonata ("sonata"=sounded), which despite its 
        name made use of four instruments: two violins, a cello (a much lower 
        string instrument), and a harpsichord (a keyboard instrument within which 
        strings are plucked). (The cello played the same music as did the harpsichordist's 
        left hand; thus, there were really only three independent parts, hence 
        "trio.") The trio sonata consisted of a few short movements, some fast, 
        some slow. This movement by Domenico Gallo (active 18th c.) is fast, but 
        not as fast as some.<br>

        <br>
        The concerto called for a larger group of instruments than did the trio 
        sonata. In the concerto. a soloist or small group of soloists contrasted 
        with a larger ensemble. (But even the larger ensemble was typically far 
        smaller and more homogenous than today's symphony orchestra.) Concertos 
        often alternated between passages showing off the soloist's technical 
        prowess and passages showing off the weight of the full ensemble. The 
        most famous of Baroque violin concertos today are those collected in the 
        <i>Four Seasons</i> of Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741). Reproduced here is 
        the final movement of "Autumn," a movement representing the hunt.<br>

        <br>
        Keyboard instruments were also vehicles for virtuosic display. The toccata 
        ("toccata"=touched, as in the keys) was a one-movement showcase of intricate 
        melodic patterns and fast fingering. The name most closely associated 
        with the toccata is that of Girolamo Frescobaldi (1583-1643).<br>

        <br>
        The fugue combined the virtuosity of the toccata with a more consistent, 
        structured approach. This approached consisted of the repetition of the 
        same melody (the "subject") in a number of polyphonic "voices," which 
        voices then continued, re-introducing the subject at fairly regular intervals. 
        Pre-eminent among fugues are the 48 in J. S. Bach's collection <i>The

        <br>
        With regard to Western music, the latter half of the 18th Century is often 
        called the "Classical" period; the music of this period is considered 
        very different from that of the Baroque period. Yet the transition from 
        Baroque to Classical was gradual. Three trends of the middle years of 
        the 18th century were behind this transition.<br>
        <br>
        The first trend was known as Reform Opera. A number of composers reacted 
        against what they saw as the stilted conventions of Italian Baroque opera. 
        They wanted to make Italian opera more natural, more directly expressive, 
        with more focus on the dramatic narrative and less focus on providing 
        solo singers with passages of elaborate, showy ornamentation. The most 
        successful of these composers was Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714-1787). 
        The topics of Reform opera were not new: Gluck's opera <i>Orfeo ed Euridice</i> 
        retells the Orpheus legend, as did Monteverdi's famous <i>Orfeo</i> 150 
        years before. In the aria "Che fiero momento," Euridice sings of her trepidation 
        at being led away by Orpheus from the calm of the underworld.<br>

        The second trend was a change in the style of solo keyboard music. Carl 
        Philipp Emanuel Bach (1714-1788), a son of the (now) more famous J.S. 
        Bach, preferred not the harpsichord but the clavichord and the fortepiano, 
        instruments that could play louder or softer depending on the force with 
        which their keys were struck. Bach's keyboard music uses this dynamic 
        variability to appropriate some of the character of 18th-century Italian 
        vocal music. Bach's slow movements, such as the one reproduced here, exemplified 
        the <i>empfindsam</i> ("full of feeling") style, which was believed to 
        express restrained passion and melancholy.<br>

        <br>
        The third trend was the introduction of the symphony, a multi-movement 
        work for orchestra. Early symphonies, such as those of Giovanni Battista 
        Sammartini (1701-1775), were modeled on the overtures (introductory instrumental 
        pieces) of Baroque Italian opera.<br>

        in G Major, first movement</a> (c. 1750)<br>
        <br>
        Over time, the symphony gained in prestige; longer symphonies were written, 
        for larger orchestras. (Yet the late 18th-century orchestra still numbered 
        about 30 players, in contrast to the 70 or more players in modern orchestras.) 
        Franz Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) wrote 104 symphonies during his long career; 
        many of these were written for the private orchestra of Prince Nicholas 
        Esterhazy. The following symphony was written near the end of Haydn's 
        career, for the popular audience in London.<br>

        Haydn also wrote many examples of the string quartet, another genre born 
        in the late 18th century. "String quartet" names a certain combination 
        of instruments--two violins, viola, cello--and also names any work written 
        for this combination. Unlike the chamber music of the Baroque, the string 
        quartet lacks a basso continuo. Haydn's string quartets typically included 
        four movements, of which the last was often buoyant and rapid.<br>

        Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) toured Europe as a child prodigy; 
        upon reaching adulthood, he settled in Vienna. Although Vienna was in 
        German-speaking territory, Viennese opera was dominated by Italian style, 
        as was the opera of much of Europe. The Italian operas that Mozart wrote 
        in Vienna were in the traditional Italian <i>buffa</i> (comic) style, 
        yet they went beyond <i>buffa</i> comedy to engage social and moral issues. 
        Although <i>Don Giovanni</i> is normatively an <i>opera buffa</i>, the 
        title character is not comedic; Don Juan, as he is most often known to 
        us, womanizes with a singular ferocity and a disregard for the social 
        class of his victims. In the following excerpt, the Don's <i>buffa</i>

        The piano concerto movement reproduced here reflects both Mozart's orchestral 
        style and his style of writing for the piano, an instrument quickly gaining 
        in popularity at the expense of the harpsichord. The concerti of the Classical 
        period were usually for single soloists, as opposed to groups of soloists 
        as in <i>concerti grossi</i>; the orchestra used was comparable to that 
        used in the Classical symphony.<br>

        Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) studied with Haydn and other Classical 
        composers as a young man; he found commercial success in late 18th-century 
        Vienna, as had Haydn and Mozart. Yet Beethoven was considered a proto-Romantic 
        by his 19th-century successors. Beethoven's image as a scowling, disheveled 
        eccentric is largely undeserved, but it is true that Beethoven fought 
        deafness throughout much of his life, and that some of his music seemed 
        awkward and violent to those who first heard it. The first movement of 
        Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 is built on the sonata-form model, but its 
        famous opening and its protracted coda (ending) were novel features.<br>

        Beethoven composed string quartets throughout his life. Those written 
        near the end of his life, such as the one reproduced here, grew farther 
        and farther from the norms of Classical style. Some scholars divide Beethoven's 
        career, rather artificially, into three periods; the Symphony No. 5 belongs 
        to the second of these periods, and the String Quartet op. 131 to the 
        third. (The first period includes works that are considered to be closest 
        to the Viennese Classical style of Mozart and Haydn.)<br>

        Much of the music of the 19th century has been called "Romantic" music, 
        so that Romanticism in Western music is considered the sequel to Classicism. 
        What is certain is that many early 19th-century composers were influenced 
        by the literary Romantics, such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Poems by 
        Goethe and other German-speaking authors were set to music, to be performed 
        by solo singer and piano; these brief settings were known as <i>Lieder</i> 
        (literally, "songs"; but distinguished from the less weighty <i>Gesangen</i>). 
        Robert Schumann (1810-1856) was renowned for his <i>Lieder</i>. "Kennst 
        du das Land?" sets a passage from Goethe's epic <i>Wilhelm Meister</i>, 
        in which a young woman begs her "protector," the title character, to let 
        her return to her home.<br>

        The Romantic era was the heyday of the programmatic orchestral work. A 
        program, in the musical sense, is a narrative that is to be presented, 
        or at least suggested, by a purely instrumental composition. The French 
        composer Hector Berlioz (1803-1869) subtitled his <i>Symphonie fantastique</i> 
        "Episode in the Life of an Artist"; at the symphony's performance, he 
        distributed a program that detailed the travails of an artist suffering 
        unrequited love. (It was an open secret that the artist was a fictionalized 
        version of Berlioz himself, struck with love for with the actress Harriet 
        Smithson.) The movement reproduced here, the fourth of five, is meant 
        to depict the artist's drug-induced vision of being marched to the gallows 
        to be hung.<br>

        The 19th century was also the heyday of the piano "miniature," short in 
        length yet often emotionally charged. Fryderyk Chopin (1810-1849) was 
        born in Poland, but lived in Paris for most of his working life. He composed 
        solo piano music almost exclusively. Chopin's piano pieces did not carry 
        poetic titles, as did those of some contemporaries; instead, he assigned 
        them to different types (etude, ballade, mazurka--the last a Polish dance). 
        The "Preludes" were not introductory to other musical works, despite their 
        names; they were standalone pieces that did not fit into Chopin's other 
        categories. Chopin's 24 preludes are often played as a set.<br>

        The operas of Giusuppe Verdi (1813-1901) dominated Italian music from 
        the 1840's through the 1880's. Like many composers of the middle and late 
        19th century, Verdi was an ardent nationalist, believing that music written 
        by Italians should exemplify a particularly Italian style. This style 
        was based on a type of singing called <i>bel canto</i> ("beautifully sung"), 
        which involved continuous, flowing melodies, emphasis on vowels, and long, 
        high climaxes at dramatic points. Verdi also made heavy use of onstage 
        choruses, often creating scenes in which the singing of soloists and of 
        the chorus overlapped. Verdi's recitative passages were accompanied by 
        full orchestra, making them more continuous with arias than were 18th-century 
        recitatives, which were accompanied by harpsichord. In this scene from 
        <i>La Traviata</i>, the spurned Alfredo accuses his ex-lover Violetta 
        of infidelity, infidelity Violetta resorted to so as to protect Alfredo's 
        family name. (It's a long story!)<br>

        Like Verdi, Richard Wagner (1813-1883) dominated the opera scene of his 
        country--in Wagner's case, Germany. Also like Verdi, Wagner was a fervid 
        nationalist; he believed that German opera should be free of Italian and 
        French influence, to the point of excluding self-contained arias entirely. 
        In Wagner's ideal German opera, music, poetry, action, staging, and even 
        set design were perfectly fused in the service of a single dramatic idea, 
        as expressed through a story from Teutonic legend. (Wagner's term for 
        the product of such a fusion was <i>Gesamtkunstwerk</i>-- "total art work.") 
        Wagner intended the orchestra to play as great a role as the sung words 
        in furthering the operatic narrative. To this end, he assigned the orchestra 
        <i>Leitmotiven</i> ("leading motives"), brief melodic fragments which 
        were associated with characters, objects, or ideas presented onstage. 
        In this scene from <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>, the title characters drink 
        a magic potion that creates undying (and forbidden) love between them. 
        In the long passage without any singing, the potion takes effect as the 
        orchestra presents the "Love-Death" <i>Leitmotiv</i>, which was introduced 
        in a Prelude before the opera's action began.<br>

        In contrast to Wagner, who wrote operas almost exclusively, Johannes Brahms 
        (1833-1897) wrote no operas at all. Many Germans considered Brahms to 
        be Beethoven's first worthy successor in the field of instrumental music.

        As the 19th century ended, composers combined the symphony and the <i>Lied</i> 
        to form the symphonic <i>Lied</i>, for solo vocalist and orchestra. The 
        Austrian conductor Gustav Mahler (1860-1911) wrote numerous sets of symphonic 
        <i>Lieder</i>, as well as nine symphonies (which themselves included symphonic 
        <i>Lieder</i> as some of their movements). Reproduced here is Mahler's

        Many 20th-century composers turned away from harmonic methods that had 
        been used in music for the past 150 years. The Frenchman Claude Debussy 
        (1862-1918) rejected the rules of 19th-century harmony as they were taught 
        in the Paris Conservatoire, instead infusing his practice with harmonic 
        techniques from East Asia and Russia. Debussy's association with French 
        painters of his time has led some people to label him and his music "Impressionist." 
        Debussy did share with the Impressionist painters a propensity for depicting 
        nature; the orchestral piece reproduced here, one of three "nocturnes," 
        is entitled "Clouds." (Debussy's "nocturnes" are not related to Chopin's 
        use of the term.) With Debussy, we enter the "Modern" era of Western art 
        music, an era which presumably continues to the present day.<br>

        Igor Stravinsky (1882-1971) also wrote music that did not use the harmonic 
        methods of the 19th century. Stravinsky incorporated the folk music of 
        his native Russia into his early compositions, while using harmonic techniques 
        that were radically modern at the time. The subject of Stravinsky's ballet 
        <i>Le Sacre du Printemps</i> ("The Rite of Spring"), a pagan ritual of 
        human sacrifice, was meant to recall "primitive" culture. The excerpt 
        here accompanied one of the ballet's many depictions of ritual dances 
        preceding a final virgin sacrifice.<br>

        The American Charles Ives (1874-1954) was yet another composer to react 
        negatively to the strictures of prior musical practice. Ives blended, 
        overlaid, and contrasted snippets of music from all walks of American 
        life: the country church, the dance hall, and the military base. Military 
        music is most evident in "Putnam's Camp, Redding, Connecticut," a musical 
        representation of the Revolutionary army marching at the winter quarters 
        of General Israel Putnam. The tunes "Yankee Doodle" and "The British Grenadiers" 
        are woven into the music, as is John Philip Sousa's march "Semper Fidelis."<br>

        Bela Bartok (1881-1945) was not only a composer and a pianist, but also 
        an ethnomusicologist: he used a gramophone to record thousands of folk 
        tunes in his native Hungary and in surrounding countries. Bartok's music 
        ranged from explicit settings of these folk tunes to abstract works which 
        bore a more subtle folk influence. The fourth movement of Bartok's String 
        Quartet #4 probably falls into the latter category. The movement is set 
        entirely in <i>pizzicato</i>--the two violins, viola, and cello are plucked 
        rather than bowed.<br>

        The music of the Austrian Arnold Schoenberg (1874-1951) grew farther and 
        farther from 19th-century harmonic models, until he was writing music 
        that has been called "atonal," meaning that, in a certain technical respect, 
        no note in it is more central than any other. (Almost no music from Gregorian 
        times through the 19th century had been atonal.) In the 1920's, Schoenberg 
        introduced the "twelve-tone system," a new technique for organizing music 
        without the need for a central note. Schoenberg's <i>Pierrot Lunaire</i>, 
        setting poems of Albert Giraud, dates from before his twelve-tone period. 
        The poems transport Pierrot, the stock character of the Italian <i>commedia 
        del'arte</i>, into alien, psychologically charged situations. <i>Pierrot 
        Lunaire</i> uses a technique called <i>Sprechstimme</i> ("speech-sound");

        The best-known work of Alban Berg (1885-1935), a student of Schoenberg, 
        is the Expressionist opera <i>Wozzeck</i>. Expressionism, associated with 
        painters and composers in Germany and Austria between the world wars, 
        took as its subject matter the irrational unconscious, inner conflict, 
        and alienation from the conventions of society. The title character of 
        <i>Wozzeck</i> is an impoverished, deranged soldier, who discovers an 
        affair between his lover Marie and the more impressive Drum Major. In 
        the scene reproduced here, Wozzeck finds himself in a crowded bar after 
        having cut Marie's throat; near the end of the scene, the crowd discovers

        Like Ives, Aaron Copland (1900-1990) drew on American folk music. Copland's 
        ballet <i>Rodeo</i> depicts life among cowboys in the Old West. The melody 
        of the final "Hoe-Down" is borrowed from traditional American fiddling.<br>

        The Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin was hostile toward "modernist" music, 
        i.e., music that broke too radically with 19th-century style and harmonic 
        technique. The Party preferred aggrandizement of itself and of the Russian 
        people by means of music that was relatively simple and triumphant. Shostakovich's 
        own tastes ran to the satirical and ironic as often as to the victorious. 
        Upon the occasion of victory over the Nazis in 1945, the prominent Russian 
        composer Dmitri Shostakovich (1906-1975) presented his Symphony No. 9. 
        Although the harmonic techniques of the symphony were only moderately 
        removed from 19th-century techniques, Soviet authorities were displeased 
        at the acid sarcasm they heard beneath the first movement's jubilant surface.<br>

        The most prominent French composer of the mid-20th century was Olivier 
        Messiaen (1908-1992). Messiaen's music was motivated by his personal brand 
        of Catholic mysticism; the sounds of bird calls and the techniques of 
        Indian classical music also influenced him. Messiaen wrote the <i>Quatuor 
        pour la fin du temps</i> while he was imprisoned in a German POW camp 
        during World War II. The title of the first movement, "Liturgy of Crystal," 
        typifies Messiaen's combination of religious themes and vivid imagery.<br>

        Music history has always been characterized by the search for ways to 
        make new kinds of sound--by constructing new instruments, by finding new 
        ways of playing old instruments, by finding new ways for performers to 
        work together. The search for new kinds of sound became particularly intense 
        in the mid-to-late 20th century. In <i>Atmospheres</i>, written by György 
        Ligeti (b. 1923), the string instruments combine to form a sound intended 
        to be different from the sound of earlier string ensemble music.<br>

        The use of early music synthesizers and the physical manipulation of magnetic 
        tape prefigured today's use of digital sampling by many composers. Karlheinz 
        Stockhausen (b. 1928) used a traditional song of religious praise as his 
        raw material in this early example.<br>

        Atonal music using Schoenberg's twelve-tone system never acquired a large 
        popular audience, but it has continued to be used throughout the 20th 
        century. More than anyone else, Milton Babbitt (b. 1916) fueled the stereotype 
        of the university-supported American composer: a cloistered figure writing 
        complex, mathematically controlled twelve-tone music for a narrow audience. 
        Yet Babbitt has often said that the goal of his computations is musical 
        beauty, not abstract cerebration.<br>

        The term "Minimalist" has been applied to late 20th-century musical works 
        which repeat relatively simple patterns at great length. Steve Reich (b. 
        1936) is one of the most prominent Minimalists. His <i>Piano Phase</i> 
        features a piano playing a short pattern of notes repeatedly; at the same 
        time, a recording of the pianist plays back at a speed slightly slower 
        than the original, so that the pianist gradually falls "out of phase" 
        with her own recording. (The work can also be performed by two pianists, 
        or by two recordings.)<br>

        Not all late 20th-century American music is atonal, minimalist, or based 
        on electronic sounds. The Oboe Concerto of John Harbison (b. 1938) is 
        a more recent composition than any of the works reproduced above, yet 
        it is considered to be relatively traditional in terms of melody, harmony, 
        rhythm, and the use of standard acoustic instruments. <br>
