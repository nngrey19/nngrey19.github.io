          <h5>Rigoletto, Verdi, 1851</h5>
          <p>
            Rigoletto is a jester at the court of the Duke of Mantua, a cruel nobleman interested only in chasing women. The Duke and his friends enjoy Rigoletto’s jokes, but they also enjoy bullying him. The one person Rigoletto truly loves is his daughter, Gilda, whom he keeps sequestered at home. Yet even Rigoletto can’t protect Gilda from the Duke’s lecherous advances, and when a revenge plot goes horribly awry, he ends up destroying Gilda herself—and any hope he may have had for his own happiness.
