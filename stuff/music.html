            <div class="sans mt12 ml18">Monody</div>
            <ul class="mt8">
              <li>
                As part of the effort to imitate ancient music, composers started focusing less on the complicated polyphony that dominated the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and more on a single voice with a simplified accompaniment, or monody.
              </li>
              <li>
                Monody is a style of accompanied solo song consisting of a single melodic line over an independent bass line or simple harmony. It arose about 1600, as a response to the contrapuntal style (based on the combination of simultaneous melodic lines) of 16th-century vocal genres such as the madrigal and motet. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Basso continuo, or figured bass, was played by an instrumentalist who was free to play any notes as long as they followed the harmonic figures written above the bass part.
              </li>
              <li>
                Giulio Caccini’s Le nuove musiche (1602; The New Music), a collection of solo songs with continuo accompaniment, exemplifies early monody, as do many solo compositions of Claudio Monteverdi. 
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="sans mt12 ml18">Sonata (smaller instrumentation)</div>
            <ul class="mt8">
              <li>
                Sonata, from the Italian word "to sound" (not to be confused with Sonata Form).
              </li>
              <li>
                A composition played by instruments (as opposed to sung, a cantata).
              </li>
              <li>
                In the Baroque period, the term sonata usually meant a work in several movements for one or more instruments (most frequently violins) and basso continuo; a sonata for two violins or other treble instruments plus bass was usually called a trio sonata.                </li>
              <li>
                By the 1650s, sonatas were often classified either as sonatas da chiesa ("church sonatas"), in four movements, or sonatas da camera ("chamber sonatas"), which consist of a series of dances akin to the suite. Examples of both types can be found in the late 17th century works of Corelli. In the 18th century, Telemann, Bach and Handel wrote numerous sonatas modeled on Corelli’s sonatas da chiesa. 
              </li>
              <li>
                The Classical sonata developed from the sonata da chiesa. The suite, or partita, are similar to the sonata da camera. In the 18th century, the terms suite and partita were practically synonymous with sonata da camera.
              </li>
              <li>
                In Corelli’s work, “solo” sonatas, for one violin with continuo, are found alongside others for two violins and continuo described as sonatas a tre (“for three”). These sonatas a tre are early examples of the trio sonata that was the principal chamber-music form until about 1750. 
              </li>
              <li>
                The rise to prominence of solo sonatas for keyboard instruments begins late in the baroque period, including those for organ (Bach) and harpsichord (Handel, Domenico Scarlatti). Other famous examples of solo sonatas include Bach’s works for unaccompanied violin and cello.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="sans mt12 ml18">Concerto (larger instrumentation)</div>
            <ul class="mt8">
              <li>
                In the concerto grosso, a small group of string instruments (concertino) alternated/contrasted with a larger group (ripieno). Handel and Corelli were notable composers.
              </li>
              <li>(Later, the concerto approached its modern form, in which the concertino is reduced to a single solo instrument playing with (or against) an orchestra.)</li>
              <li>
                The works of Corelli, particularly his Op. 6 collection, provide perhaps the best known examples of the late 17th century concerto grosso. (<a href="https://youtu.be/7o6gRHY9wx4" target="_blank"><u>Christmas Concerto, Adagio Op. 6 No. 8 Voices of Music</u></a>) While Corelli’s works were emulated in the 18th century, most notably in Handel’s Op. 6 collection, many 18th century examples of the concerto grosso show the increasing influence of the solo concerto (for example, the Brandenburg Concertos of J. S. Bach)
              </li> 
              <li>
                The most dominant type of concerto in the 18th century was the solo concerto. The most prolific composer of the solo concerto was Antonio Vivaldi

            <div class=" sans mt12 ml18">Suite</div>
            <ul class="mt8">
              <li>
                Based on the traditional pairing of dances in the Renaissance, the suite was the first multi-movement work for instruments. The suite was essentially a series of dances in the same key, most or all of them in two-part form. Johann Jakob Froberger is usually credited with establishing the classical suite (e.g., <a href="https://youtu.be/lw-ymM5NAMY" target="_blank"><u>Suite XII</u></a> for harpsichord).

              <li>A <b>cantata</b> is a poem or story set to vocal music, usually accompanied by the orchestra, either sacred or secular, similar to an Oratorio but on a smaller scale, Bach was perhaps the greatest writer of cantatas.</li>

              <li>Johann Sebastian Bach, 1685-1750, employed many forms including concerto grosso, fugue, cantata</li>
              <li>George Frideric Handel, 1685-1759, famous for operas and oratorios.</li>

            <div class=" sans mt12 ml18">Symphony</div>

              <li>
                A work usually in three or four movements, with the first movement usually in sonata form.
              </li>
              <li>
                The opera sinfonia, or Italian overture, is often considered the direct forerunner of the three-movement symphony.
              </li>
              <li>
                By the 18th century, Alessandro Scarlatti (1660–1725) had  helped standardize the opera sinfonia's structure of three contrasting movements: fast, slow, fast and dance-like. 
              </li>
              <li>
                The Italian composer Giovanni Battista Sammartini incorporated the fast-slow-fast movement structure in most of his symphonic works, and he started using an early version of sonata-form for his first movements.
              </li>
              <li>
               In the mid-1700s, Johann Stamitz, composer for the Mannheim Orchestra, began composing four-movement symphonies. He expanded the length of the sonata-form in the first movements and created greater contrast between the two themes (see, for example, his Symphony in E-flat op. 11 #3). 
              </li>
              <li>
                Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven further developed the four-movement pattern, starting with a movement in sonata form followed by a slower movement, a Minuet and a lively finale.
              </li>
              <li>
