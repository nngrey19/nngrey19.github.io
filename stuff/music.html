              Prior to the 16th century, most "cultured" music was vocal. Instrumental music played an important role in dance, but for the most part, it was not played for its own sake. That began to change during the Renaissance, and especially, the Baroque periods.
            </p>
            <p>
              Major vocal forms during the Baroque period include the oratorio, opera and cantata. Major instrumental forms include the sonata, concerto, fugue and suite.

            <ul class="mt8 dashed">
              <li>
                Musical monody was developed by the Florentine Camerata in the 1580s to restore ancient Greek ideas of melody and declamation (probably with little historical accuracy). In part, it was a reaction against the complicated polyphony that dominated the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. 
              </li>
              <li>
                In monody one solo voice sings a melodic part, usually with considerable ornamentation, over a rhythmically independent bass line.
              </li>
              <li>
                Basso continuo, or figured bass, was played by an instrumentalist who was free to play any notes as long as they followed the harmonic figures written above the bass part.
              </li>
              <li>
                Giulio Caccini’s Le nuove musiche (1602; The New Music), a collection of solo songs with continuo accompaniment, exemplifies early monody, as do many solo compositions of Claudio Monteverdi.

              <p>
                An oratorio is an extended musical drama with a text based on religious subject matter. There is usually little or no interaction between the characters in oratorio; there is neither scenery nor action.

              <li>

              <li>
                The term "cantata" changed over time, from the simple single-voice madrigal of the early 17th century, to the multi-voice "cantata da camera" and the "cantata da chiesa" of the later part of that century.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Italian solo cantata tended, when on a large scale, to become indistinguishable from a scene in an opera, in the same way the church cantata, solo or choral, is indistinguishable from a small oratorio or portion of an oratorio.

              <li>
                Originating in the early 17th century, the trio sonata was a favorite chamber ensemble combination in the Baroque era. 
              </li>
              <li>                
                The trio sonata typically consisted of three parts, two violins and continuo. The the basso continuo has two components. First, it includes the bass line, which commonly was played by a bass viol, violone, violoncello, or bassoon. Second, it includes a harmony-producing instrument, such as a small organ, a harpsichord, or a theorbo.
              </li>
              <li>
                From about the middle of the 17th century two distinct types of sonatas appeared: sonata da camera (chamber sonata) and sonata da chiesa (church sonata). Sonatas da chiesa ("church sonatas") usually consists of four movements, in the order slow–fast–slow–fast. Sonatas da camera ("chamber sonatas") often consisted of a prelude followed by a succession of dances. (After 1700, works comprising dance movements came to be called a variety of other names, such as partita, suite, ordre, ouverture, or air.)

                The concerto grosso is a baroque musical composition in which the musical material is passed between a small group of soloists (the concertino) and full orchestra (the ripieno, tutti or concerto grosso).

                The opera sinfonia, or Italian overture, is often considered the direct forerunner of the three-movement symphony.
              </li>
              <li>
                By the 18th century, Alessandro Scarlatti (1660–1725) had helped standardize the opera sinfonia's structure of three contrasting movements: fast, slow, fast and dance-like. 
              </li>
              <li>
                The Italian composer Giovanni Battista Sammartini incorporated the fast-slow-fast movement structure in most of his symphonic works, and he started using an early version of sonata-form for his first movements.
              </li>
              <li>
               In the mid-1700s, Johann Stamitz, composer for the Mannheim Orchestra, began composing four-movement symphonies. He expanded the length of the sonata-form in the first movements and created greater contrast between the two themes (see, for example, his Symphony in E-flat op. 11 #3). 
              </li>
              <li>
                Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven further developed the four-movement pattern, starting with a movement in sonata form followed by a slower movement, a Minuet and a lively finale.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sonata form is in three parts - exposition, development, and recapitulation.
