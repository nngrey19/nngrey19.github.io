            <li>Sometimes it feels like the world is headed for disaster. So far, it hasn't happened.</li>
            <li>
              Everyone makes mistakes, but most people are <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-probe-human-nature-and-discover-we-are-good-after-all/"><u>basically good</u></a>, including me.
            </li> -->
            <li>Be patient, friendly and kind throughout the day.</li>

          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>"Let Go and Let God"</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This popular AA saying directly mirrors the Taoist concept of surrendering control</li>

            </li>
            <li><strong>"Acceptance is the Answer"</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>From page 417 of the Big Book (4th edition): "Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life's terms, I cannot be happy"</li>
                    <li>This mirrors the Taoist emphasis on accepting what is rather than fighting reality</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>"Easy Does It"</strong>
                <ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>"Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help..."</li>
                    <li>Emphasizes surrendering control rather than forcing solutions</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>"Life on Life's Terms"</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Popular AA phrase emphasizing accepting reality as it comes</li>
                    <li>Encourages dealing with situations as they are, not as we wish them to be</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>From the Big Book:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>"And acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation – some fact of my life – unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment."</li>
