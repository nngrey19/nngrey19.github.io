            <h3>The List</h3>
          </div>
          <p><i>Dr. Andrew Childs</i></p>
          <p>
            This installment focuses entirely on the good, a collection of pieces that in my estimation provides the
            best composite representation of composed music. Looking beyond the popular abuse of list-making, instead
            considering the innate cognitive tendency to organize both in quantitative and qualitative terms, I offer
            here my list of “The 100 Greatest Pieces of Music Ever Composed”—or something like it—intending not to
            propose the definitive “Top 100” (impossible), but rather to assemble a collection of works surpassing in
            quality and importance. I hope it will serve as a reference for those beginning a listening library, inspire
            those who have already begun the process, and engage those with already established libraries.
          </p>
          <p>
            The challenge in such an exercise lies in organization and in maintaining the distinction between objective
            ranking and subjective list-making of this type. Balance, in terms of epoch and genre, though important,
            cannot sufficiently moderate the discussion. No injustice occurs in having Beethoven and Schubert as
            contemporaries (or Verdi and Wagner); the job remains to compile a group of works related by their lasting
            impact regardless of chronological distribution. In terms of numbers, the 18th and 19th centuries will
            contribute many more likely individual candidates than most others, perhaps all others combined. Yet, while
            including a less significant piece from a less productive era to the exclusion of, for instance, another
            Beethoven symphony may seem unfair, it does not transgress justice anymore than the supernatural decree that
            determined the inequitable distribution of talent across the ages. A generation devoid of great artistic
            contributions will not likely inspire the developments of the next, and though the giants seem to stand
            alone, inevitably important and recognizable influence almost always existed to inspire. Thinking along
            these lines, tracing developmental trends throughout history reveals stepping stones at regular intervals
            even in periods of relative inactivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Composers have left their artistic mark on history in various ways. Some have innovated, others perfected;
            some have built up, others destroyed; some have defined themselves by the trends they developed, others have
            defined themselves by resisting trend altogether. In the case of Perotin and Hildegard von Bingen, the music
            that followed them could not have existed without them; in the case of Beethoven and his nearly destructive
            disregard for formal convention, one marvels that any recognizable music at all could exist after him.
            Monteverdi the Renaissance master leaves systematic evidence in his nine books of madrigals of the epic
            shift from modal to tonal compositional sensibilities. Others defied such “evolutionary pressures”—Elgar,
            Holst, Vaughan Williams, Rachmaninov, Sibelius are among a generation of composers straddling the 19th and
            20th centuries who remain underrated in elite circles if only because they insisted on writing defiantly
            beautiful and structurally traditional music at a time when musical modernism and abstractism exerted
            increasing influence. Bach and Ives fit neatly nowhere, artistic cul-de-sacs explicable perhaps by what
            preceded them, but unique not only in their reaction to these preceding influences, but also in their shared
            ability to write music of lasting importance in a style nearly none chose to imitate. Mozart never had to
            work hard enough to innovate—too much talent—and instead went beyond perfecting forms to toying with them;
            Schubert’s reserved genius could never rise above the din of Beethoven; Mendelssohn never wrote a misplaced
            note and ranks only behind Mozart as a prodigy, but composed so politely as never to have made an impact in
            any relation to his talent; other composers—Catholics in Tudor England, Soviet-era Russians—worried less
            about honestly pouring out their hearts than literally keeping their heads. All of these artists responded
            to their talents and circumstances by creating the masterworks listed below.
          </p>

            Regarding formatting, three things: dates, annotation, and classification. Dates provide not only a sense of
            historical context, but also a sobering reminder of mortality: many of these greats died shockingly young
            (see Berlioz, Schubert, Mozart, Purcell, and do the math…one wonders what the next decades would have
            produced). In terms of the brief accompanying annotation, I intend to provide some justification and
            historical context. Finally, I’ve classified the works as belonging in one (or perhaps two) of three
            categories: “AA” stands for “All Ages,” substantive yet immediately accessible music, mostly masterpieces
            composed in predictable forms and standard genres—many Baroque favorites fall into this category; “TYL”
            stands for “Try it—You’ll Like it!,” pieces slightly more challenging to the ear and not suitable for
            “background” music, but still comprehensible and rewarding to most after a few hearings; “HL” stands for
            “Heavy Lifting” (alternately referred to “ITSSG?”, or “Is This Supposed to Sound Good?”). HL pieces tend to
            fall into the “important” rather than the “beloved” category, and benefit from some technical training, or
            from extensive listening experience; though not immediately pleasing or comprehensible, these works
            nonetheless represent important phases of development. Now, The List…
