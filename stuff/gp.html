          <h3>Daily thoughts</h3>
          <ul>  
            <li>Very quietly God speaks through your thoughts and feelings. Listen for this and you will never be disappointed. 24HAD</li>
            <li>Wu-wei, effortless action, going with the flow.</li>

              Most people are <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-probe-human-nature-and-discover-we-are-good-after-all/"><u>basically good</u></a>, including me.
            </li>
            <li>As we go through the day, we pause, when agitated or doubtful, and ask for the right thought or action.  BB 87-8</li>
            <li>Nothing pays off like restraint of tongue and pen. </li>
            <li>Do the next right thing.</li>
            <li>I am responsible for showing up, being good, and working hard. The rest is in God's hands.</li>
            <li>Practice mindfulness and gratitude throughout the day.</li>
            <li>An honest regret for harms done, a genuine gratitude for blessings received, and a willingness to try for better things tomorrow will be the permanent assets we shall seek.</li>
            <li>It's good to be alive, <br>I am blessed, <br>Everything is going to be okay.</li>
