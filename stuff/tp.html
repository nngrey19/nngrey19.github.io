          <h3>Tao Principles</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Tao</b> or Dao is the natural order of the universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Life is a web of interconnectedness; the one constant in life is change; but every change occurs within a larger system that is seeking a state of balance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Humans, being part of the Tao, can follow the balanced, harmonious flow found in nature by practicing the same principles that govern the functioning of the universe. This process of alignment should be natural to us if we allow our true natures to emerge.

          <p><b>Te</b>, <i>virtue</i>, is living in harmony with Tao. It is following the natural way.</p>

          <p>
            Nature is an organic, interconnected whole that undergoes constant transformation. Gaining an awareness of life's unity and learning to cooperate with its natural flow is the essence of Taoism.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Wu-wei</b>, effortless action, occurs naturally when we feel connected to others and our environment. In this state, our actions flow through us because they are appropriate to the time and place. We are going with the flow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lao Tzu writes that we must be quiet and watchful, listening to our own inner voice and to the voices around us. In this way, we develop our intuition as a direct connection to the Tao.
