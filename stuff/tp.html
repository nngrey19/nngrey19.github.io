          <h3>Tao Principles</h3>
          <ul>  
            <li><i><b>Tao</b></i>, the Way, represents the primordial laws of nature. It is the way the world works. Tao made the world spring into being and governs how all things behave.</li>
            <li><i><b>Te</b></i>, Virtue, is living in harmony with Tao. It is following the natural way.</li>
            <li><i><b>Wu Wei</b></i>, Non-action, is the idea that we should not hurry to act, and when we do act, we should do so cautiously. The world is run perfectly by Tao, so there is little need for human intervention. </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.taoistic.com/taothemes/"><u>- Tao Themes</u></a></li>
            <li>Try to be patient, friendly and kind throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Practice restraint of pen and tongue.</li>
            <li>Find joy in what the world has to offer.</li>
            <li>I am grateful for ...</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Nature is an organic, interconnected whole that undergoes constant transformation. This unceasing flow of change manifests itself as a natural order governed by unalterable, yet perceivable laws. Learning to cooperate with this natural flow enables people to be at one with the Tao. 
          </p>
          <p>
             Wu-wei, non-doing, arises from a sense of oneself as connected to others and to one's environment. It is not to be considered inertia, laziness, or passivity. Rather, it is the experience of going with the grain or swimming with the current. 
          </p>
          <p>
             The principle of wu-wei implies the need to consciously experience ourselves as part of the unity of life that is the Tao. Lao Tzu writes that we must be quiet and watchful, learning to listen to both our own inner voices and to the voices of our environment in a receptive manner. In this way, we develop and trust our intuition as our direct connection to the Tao.
          </p>
          <p>
              Wu-wei implies action that is spontaneous, natural, and effortless. It flows through us because it is the right action, appropriate to its time and place. Chuang Tzu refers to this type of being in the world as flowing, or more poetically as "purposeless wandering!"
