          <h3>Tao Principles</h3>
            <p><b>Tao</b>, <i>the Way</i>, made the world spring into being and governs how all things behave. It is the way the world works, the primordial laws of nature.</p>
            <p><b>Te</b>, <i>virtue</i>, is living in harmony with Tao. It is following the natural way.</p>
            <p><b>Wu Wei</b>, <i>non-action</i>, is the idea that we should not hurry to act, and when we do act, we should do so cautiously. The world is governed by Tao, so there is little need for human intervention. </p>

          <p>
            Nature is an organic, interconnected whole that undergoes constant transformation. This unceasing flow is governed by unalterable, yet perceivable laws. Learning to cooperate with the natural flow all people to be at one with the Tao. 
          </p>
          <p>
             Wu-wei, non-doing, arises naturally when we feel connected to others and our environment - that is, to the Tao. It is the experience of going with the flow. 
          </p>
          <p>
             Wu-wei requires us to experience ourselves as part of the unity of life. Lao Tzu writes that we must be quiet and watchful, learning to listen to our own inner voice and to the voices around us. In this way, we develop our intuition as a direct connection to the Tao.
          </p>
          <p>
              Wu-wei implies action that is spontaneous, natural, and effortless. The action flows through us because it is appropriate to its time and place.
