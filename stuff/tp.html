          <h3>Tao Principles</h3>
            <p><b>Tao</b>, <i>the Way</i>, made the world spring into being and governs how all things behave. It is the way the world works, the primordial laws of nature.</p>
            <p><b>Te</b>, <i>virtue</i>, is living in harmony with Tao. It is following the natural way.</p>

          <p>
            Nature is an organic, interconnected whole that undergoes constant transformation. Gaining an awareness of life's unity and learning to cooperate with the natural flow is the essence of Taoism.

            <b>Wu-wei</b>, effortless action, occurs naturally when we feel connected to others and our environment. In this state, our actions flow through us because they are appropriate to the time and place. We are going with the flow and are a part of the flow.
          </p>

            Lao Tzu writes that we must be quiet and watchful, listening to our own inner voice and to the voices around us. In this way, we develop our intuition as a direct connection to the Tao.
