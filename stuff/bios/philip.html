            <h3>Philip the Good</h3>
            <img src="../bios/images/philip.jpg" style="height: 350px">
            <p>Philip the Good ruled as the Duke of Burgundy from 1419 until his death. He had no fixed capital and moved the court between various palaces in Brussels, Bruges, and Lille.</p>
            <p>He was known for his patronage of Flemish artists (such as Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden) and of Franco-Flemish composers (such as Gilles Binchois and Guillaume Dufay), and for the 1430 seizure of Joan of Arc, whom Philip ransomed to the English, resulting in her trial and eventual execution.</p>
            <p>His son and heir was Charles the Bold. Charles the Bold's daughter and heir, Mary of Burgundy, married Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, leading to Burgundy territories coming under Habsburg control for centuries after.</p>
            <p><strong>Patronage:</strong> 
              Philip supported Flemish artists, such as Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden and Franco-Flemish composers, such as Gilles Binchois and Guillaume Dufay.
