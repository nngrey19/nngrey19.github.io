            <h3>Guillaume Dufay</h3>
            <img src="../bios/images/dufay.jpg" style="width: 650px">
            <p>Guillaume Dufay (c. 1397–1474) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance period.</p>

            <p><strong>Nationality:</strong> Franco-Flemish</p>

            <p><strong>Location:</strong> Born in Brussels, present-day Belgium</p>

            <p><strong>Patrons:</strong> Dufay had various patrons, including the Papal Chapel, the Duke of Savoy, and the Medici family in Florence.</p>

            <p><strong>Known for:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Dufay frequently incorporated secular tunes, such as "L'homme armé" ("The Armed Man"), into his Mass compositions. This practice of integrating popular melodies into sacred contexts was influential and paved the way for later composers to explore similar approaches.</li>
                    <li>Dufay is associated with the development of the cyclic Mass, where the movements of the Mass (Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Agnus Dei) share a common musical theme. This approach provided a unified and cohesive structure to the Mass setting.</li>
                </ul>


            <p><strong>Most Influential Works:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><em>"Nuper rosarum flores"</em> - A motet composed for the dedication of the Florence Cathedral in 1436.</li>
                <li><em>"Missa Se la face ay pale"</em> - A Mass setting known for its musical beauty and incorporation of secular melodies.</li>
                <li><em>"Missa L'homme armé"</em> - A famous Mass setting based on the secular tune "L'homme armé."</li>
