              While each of the novels in the Aubrey–Maturin series challenge the reader with their specialized language and abrupt plotting, this installment seemed especially demanding. We hop from battles at sea to torture houses in Catalan to the streets of Calcutta. There is quite a bit of odd extraneous action along the way, like Maturin visiting an island and nearly getting swept away in a storm and the Ambassador Stanhope dying on the beach of some distant land.

              Perhaps the oddest aspect of this novel is the portrayal of Dil. Dil is an Indian street urchin who is befriended by Maturin. While she is something of a sympathetic character, O'Brian really struggles to realize her. She turns out like a cross between Mowgli and Iago. I suppose O'Brian was attempting to make her exotic, but she he goes so overboard it is hard to read. In general, Dil and her mother are portrayed as barbaric and unnatural. It is a bit disapponting that an author so attuned to detail and subtlty in sailing could be so clueless when it comes to characters from another culture. I suppose that is very British of him.
