              The Frankish kings were the rulers of the Frankish people, a Germanic tribe that inhabited the region that is now France, Belgium, and parts of Germany and the Netherlands, among other areas, from the 3rd century to the 8th century. Here are some of the most significant Frankish / French royal dynasties:
            </p>
            <p>
              Merovingian Dynasty (481-751): The Merovingian Dynasty was the first dynasty of Frankish kings to rule over a united Frankish kingdom. The most famous ruler of this dynasty was Clovis I, who converted to Christianity and established a powerful Frankish kingdom in Gaul.
            </p>  
            <p>
              Charles Martel (c. 686-741) was a Frankish general and statesman. He was the father of Pepin the Short and the grandfather of Charlemagne. He led his troops to victory over the Umayyad Caliphate at the Battle of Tours in 732.
            </p>   
            <p>
              Carolingian Dynasty (751-987): The Carolingian dynasty was either named after Charles Martel or Charlemagne. Its founder was either Charles Martel, or his son Pepin the Short, who deposed the last Merovingian king and became the first king of the Carolingian dynasty, or by Charlemagne. Charlemagne was crowned as the Holy Roman Emperor in 800 AD. The Carolingian Dynasty ruled over a vast empire that included much of modern-day France, Germany, and Italy.
            </p>     
            <p>
              Capetian Dynasty (987-1328): The Capetian Dynasty was founded by Hugh Capet, who became King of France in 987 AD. The Capetians ruled France for over 300 years and oversaw the development of the French monarchy as a centralized and powerful institution.
            </p>      
            <p>
              Valois Dynasty (1328-1589): The Valois Dynasty succeeded the Capetians and ruled France for over 250 years. This dynasty was marked by several significant events, including the Hundred Years' War with England and the French Wars of Religion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bourbon Dynasty (1589-1792): The Bourbon Dynasty was founded by Henry IV, who became King of France in 1589. The Bourbons were among the most powerful and influential dynasties in French history and oversaw many important developments in French culture, politics, and society.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bonaparte Dynasty (1804-1814): The Bonaparte Dynasty was founded by Napoleon Bonaparte, who became Emperor of the French in 1804. This dynasty was relatively short-lived, lasting only a decade, but it had a significant impact on French history and helped to shape modern France.
