              The Greek modes were a system of scales used in ancient Greek music. They were based on a series of seven notes, each with a unique pattern of intervals. The seven modes were:

    Ionian: This mode corresponds to the major scale in modern Western music and has a bright, cheerful character.

    Dorian: This mode has a minor tonality and is characterized by a melancholy, introspective mood.

    Phrygian: This mode has a distinctive character, with its flattened second note creating a sense of tension and unease.

    Lydian: This mode has a bright, upbeat character and is characterized by its raised fourth note.

    Mixolydian: This mode has a dominant tonality and is often used in blues and rock music.

    Aeolian: This mode corresponds to the natural minor scale in modern Western music and has a sad, introspective character.

    Locrian: This mode is characterized by its flattened fifth note and has a dark, mysterious character.
    
    Musicians did not necessarily abandon the Greek modes; rather, the development of Western music over time led to a shift away from the use of the Greek modes in favor of other scales and modes.

    One reason for this shift was the development of polyphonic music in the Western tradition, which involved the use of multiple melodies and harmonies played simultaneously. The Greek modes, which were originally used mainly in monophonic music, were not well suited to this new style of music.

    Another reason was the influence of the Church, which became a dominant cultural and artistic force in Europe during the Middle Ages. The Church favored the use of certain modes, such as the Ionian and Aeolian modes, which became the basis for the major and minor scales used in Western music today.

              The development of harmony in Western music is a complex and multifaceted process that evolved over several centuries. Here are some of the key factors that contributed to its development:

    Polyphony: Polyphony refers to the use of multiple melodies or voices played simultaneously. Polyphonic music emerged in the Middle Ages, and the use of counterpoint - the combination of independent melodies - led to the development of harmony. As composers began to experiment with different melodic lines and combinations, they discovered new harmonies that were not possible in monophonic music.

    Chords: Chords are groups of three or more notes played together. The use of chords in Western music can be traced back to the Renaissance, where composers began to use triads - chords consisting of three notes - to create harmonic progressions. This led to the development of tonal harmony, which became the dominant harmonic system in Western music from the Baroque period onwards.
              
              Functional harmony: Functional harmony is a system of harmony based on the relationships between chords and their functions in a musical context. It emerged during the Baroque period and became more complex in the Classical period. In this system, chords are organized into hierarchical structures, with the tonic chord serving as the tonal center and other chords providing tension and resolution.

Chromaticism: Chromaticism is the use of notes outside of the diatonic scale, creating new and unexpected harmonies. Composers in the Romantic period began to use chromaticism more extensively, leading to the development of more complex and colorful harmonies.

Jazz and popular music: Jazz and popular music also played a significant role in the development of harmony. In jazz, composers and performers used extended chords and chord progressions that departed from traditional tonal harmony. In popular music, the use of non-Western scales and modes, as well as electronic instruments and production techniques, have led to new harmonic possibilities.

In summary, the development of harmony in Western music was a gradual and multifaceted process that was influenced by a variety of factors, including polyphony, chords, functional harmony, chromaticism, and jazz and popular music. This ongoing evolution has led to the rich and diverse harmonic language used in music today.

              Tonal harmony is a harmonic system that developed in Western music from the Baroque period through the Classical and Romantic periods. It is based on the use of a tonal center or "key" - a specific pitch or note that serves as a point of reference for the entire composition. In tonal harmony, chords are organized hierarchically around the tonal center, with certain chords providing tension and others providing resolution.

The tonal system is built on the major and minor scales, which are diatonic scales consisting of seven notes. The notes of the scale are organized in a specific pattern of intervals, with half steps (or semitones) and whole steps (or whole tones) creating a specific sequence of notes. For example, the C major scale consists of the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, and B, with the intervals between the notes following the pattern whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half.

Chords in tonal harmony are constructed by stacking thirds on top of each other. For example, a C major chord consists of the notes C, E, and G, which are the first, third, and fifth notes of the C major scale. The most important chords in tonal harmony are the tonic, dominant, and subdominant chords, which form the foundation of the tonal system.

Tonal harmony is characterized by its use of functional harmony, which involves the use of chords with specific functions in relation to the tonal center. The tonic chord provides a sense of stability and resolution, while the dominant chord creates tension and leads to resolution on the tonic chord. The subdominant chord provides a sense of stability and helps to establish the tonal center.

In summary, tonal harmony is a harmonic system based on the use of a tonal center and a hierarchical organization of chords around that center. It is characterized by its use of functional harmony and the major and minor scales, and it was the dominant harmonic system in Western music from the Baroque period through the Romantic period.

              Polyphony and counterpoint are related terms that refer to different aspects of musical texture.

Polyphony refers to the use of multiple independent melodic lines or voices played simultaneously. Polyphonic music emerged in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and it often involves different voices or instruments playing different melodies at the same time. Polyphony can be simple, with just two or three voices, or complex, with multiple voices weaving in and out of each other.

Counterpoint, on the other hand, refers to the specific technique of combining multiple independent melodies in a harmonically pleasing way. It involves the careful arrangement of voices so that they complement and enhance each other, rather than conflicting or creating dissonance. In other words, counterpoint is a specific approach to writing polyphonic music.

Counterpoint involves a set of rules or principles that dictate how the melodies should be combined. For example, there are rules about the intervals between the melodies, the timing and rhythm of each voice, and the overall shape and structure of the composition. Composers who write in a contrapuntal style need to be knowledgeable about these rules and skilled in applying them to their music.

In summary, polyphony refers to the use of multiple independent melodies or voices played simultaneously, while counterpoint is a specific technique for combining those melodies in a harmonically pleasing way. Counterpoint is one approach to writing polyphonic music, but it is not the only one.

              However, the Parthians did draw on some of the cultural and administrative traditions of the Achaemenid Empire. For example, they adopted some of the Achaemenid administrative practices, such as the use of satraps (provincial governors) to govern their territories.

              The Parthian Empire was established in the same region as the Persian Empire, and the Parthians considered themselves the rightful heirs to the legacy of Iranian culture and civilization that had been established by the Achaemenids.

              The Sassanid Empire was an ancient Persian empire that existed from 224 CE to 651 CE. It was founded by Ardashir I, who overthrew the Parthian Empire and established himself as the new king of Persia.

              The Arab Muslim conquests in the 7th century CE were a series of military campaigns that were carried out by Arab Muslim armies against the Byzantine Empire, Sassanid Empire, and other neighboring states.

            <p>
              The Sassanid Empire ultimately fell to the Arab Muslim conquests in the 7th century CE, which marked the beginning of the Islamic Golden Age and the spread of Islam throughout the region.
