              Edward III was the King of England from 1327 until his death in 1377. He was born on November 13, 1312, in Windsor, England, and was the eldest son of King Edward II and Queen Isabella. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Roger Mortimer, an English nobleman, was a key figure in the movement to remove Edward II from power, due to his unpopular policies. In 1326, Mortimer and Queen Isabella led a successful rebellion against the Edward, and he was forced to abdicate in favor of his son, Edward III.
            </p>
            <p>
              Edward III began his reign as a minor, with his mother and her lover, Roger Mortimer, acting as regents. In 1330, he overthrew Mortimer and took full control of the government.
            </p>
            <p>
              Edward's mother, Queen Isabella, was the daughter of King Philip IV of France, which made Edward III a grandson of the French king. When the last Capetian king of France, Charles IV, died in 1328 without a male heir, Edward III argued that he was the rightful heir to the French throne. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Edward's claim to the French throne was not recognized by the French authorities, and his attempts to assert his right to the throne led to the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War between England and France.
            </p>  
            <p>
              The Hundred Years' War was waged in several stages:
            </p>
            <p>
              The War of Edward III (1337-1360): During this stage the English won several battles, including the Battle of Crecy in 1346, but were unable to capture Paris. In 1360, the two sides signed the Treaty of Bretigny, which recognized Edward III's right to the French provinces of Aquitaine, Calais, and Gascony.
            </p>
            <p>
              The War of Charles V (1369-1380): This stage saw the French king, Charles V, launch a counter-attack against the English. The French won several battles and regained some of the territories lost in the previous stage. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The War of Richard II (1380-1399): This stage began with Richard II's attempts to assert English authority in France. The English suffered several defeats, and in 1396, Richard II agreed to a 28-year truce with France.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Lancastrian War (1415-1429): This stage saw the English king, Henry V, invade France and win a decisive victory at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. The stage ended with the English regaining control of Normandy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Valois War (1429-1453): This stage saw the French king, Charles VII, launch a successful counter-attack against the English, led by Joan of Arc. The French won several key battles and gradually regained control of their territories. The war ended with the French victory at the Battle of Castillon in 1453, which marked the end of the Hundred Years' War.
            </p>   
            <p>
              The Parthian Empire was established in the same region as the Persian Empire, and the Parthians considered themselves the rightful heirs to the legacy of Iranian culture and civilization that had been established by the Achaemenids.
