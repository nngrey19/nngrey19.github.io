              Edward II was the King of England from 1307 until he was deposed in 1327. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Edward II's reign was marked by a number of challenges and controversies. One of the most significant was his relationship with Piers Gaveston, a close friend and adviser who was despised by many of the nobles. The nobles saw Gaveston as a threat to their power and influence, and they pressured Edward to banish him. However, Edward repeatedly brought Gaveston back to court, which led to increasing tension between the king and his nobles.

            <p>
              Another major challenge during Edward II's reign was his conflict with Scotland. He was defeated by the Scottish king Robert the Bruce in the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, which is considered one of the most significant Scottish victories over England.
            </p>
            <p>
              Edward II's reign also saw the rise of his queen, Isabella of France, who played a significant role in his eventual downfall. In 1325, Isabella went to France on a diplomatic mission and did not return for three years. During this time, she began an affair with Roger Mortimer, an exiled English noble. Together, Isabella and Mortimer raised an army and invaded England, forcing Edward to abdicate in favor of his son, who became King Edward III.
            </p>
            <p>
              Edward III was the King of England from 1327 until his death in 1377. He was born on November 13, 1312, in Windsor, England, and was the eldest son of King Edward II and Queen Isabella. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Edward III began his reign as a minor, with his mother and her lover, Roger Mortimer, acting as regents. In 1330, he overthrew Mortimer and took full control of the government.
            </p>
            <p>
              Edward's mother, Queen Isabella, was the daughter of King Philip IV of France, which made Edward III a grandson of the French king. When the last Capetian king of France, Charles IV, died in 1328 without a male heir, Edward III argued that he was the rightful heir to the French throne. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Edward's claim to the French throne was not recognized by the French authorities, and his attempts to assert his right to the throne led to the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War between England and France.
            </p>  
            <p>
              The Hundred Years' War was waged in several stages:
            </p>
            <p>
              The War of Edward III (1337-1360): During this stage the English won several battles, including the Battle of Crecy in 1346, but were unable to capture Paris. In 1360, the two sides signed the Treaty of Bretigny, which recognized Edward III's right to the French provinces of Aquitaine, Calais, and Gascony.
            </p>
            <p>
              The War of Charles V (1369-1380): This stage saw the French king, Charles V, launch a counter-attack against the English. The French won several battles and regained some of the territories lost in the previous stage. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The War of Richard II (1380-1399): This stage began with Richard II's attempts to assert English authority in France. The English suffered several defeats, and in 1396, Richard II agreed to a 28-year truce with France.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Lancastrian War (1415-1429): This stage saw the English king, Henry V, invade France and win a decisive victory at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. The stage ended with the English regaining control of Normandy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Valois War (1429-1453): This stage saw the French king, Charles VII, launch a successful counter-attack against the English, led by Joan of Arc. The French won several key battles and gradually regained control of their territories. The war ended with the French victory at the Battle of Castillon in 1453, which marked the end of the Hundred Years' War.
