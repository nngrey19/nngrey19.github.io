              The Holy Roman Empire was a complex political entity that existed from 962 to 1806, and during its long history, it was ruled by a succession of emperors who held varying degrees of power and authority. Here are some of the most significant rulers of the Holy Roman Empire:
            </p>
            <p>
              Otto I (962-973): Otto I, also known as Otto the Great, was the first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. He was a powerful ruler who oversaw significant territorial expansion and helped to establish the Holy Roman Empire as a major political and cultural force in Europe. Some historians refer to the coronation of Charlemagne as the origin of the empire, while others prefer the coronation of Otto I as its beginning.
            </p>  
            <p>
              Charles V (1519-1556): Charles V was one of the most powerful monarchs in European history and ruled over a vast empire that included much of modern-day Europe, as well as territories in the Americas and Asia. He was a major player in the political and religious conflicts of the time, including the Reformation and the wars between Catholic and Protestant states.
            </p>   
            <p>
              Francis II (1792-1806): Francis II was the last emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1804, following the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, Francis II declared himself Emperor of Austria, which would later become the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Habsburg Empire.
