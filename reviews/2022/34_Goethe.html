              Lot's of events to report. We are in the middle of a terrible cold snap with temperatures in the teens. The cold water supply to the kitchen froze and I had to cut holes in the basement ceiling so that I could thaw it and then insulate.

              Anne is in India with her mother. She has been gone for a few weeks and still has another three weeks before she returns. Sheru and I are braving it alone. Sheru can be a handful at times but we are generally doing okay.

              At work, my boss got a new job so there will be some transition on our team. I hope it will all work out because I do not feel quite prepared to retire but we will see.

              I just finished Goethe's Elective Affinities, an odd little novella that came recommended from the New York Time's Read like the Wind newsletter. It was engaging but a bit on the fantastical side. Perhaps it is meant as a fable.

              Other recent reads include Kim Stanley Robinson's The Ministry for the Future, which charts out a possible future for our planet as it grapple with global warming. It reminded me a bit of the terra-forming activities he described in his Mars series. Oddly enough, I found it hopeful, perhaps because I don't have the imagination to see a way forward for our world.

              I also reread Martha Wells Rogue Protocol, part of the Murderbot Diaries series. Fun but not particularly well written.

              I have been focusing on one composer a week for a couple months now. I am creating a timeline/selected works list <a href="/stuff/composers.html">here</a>.
