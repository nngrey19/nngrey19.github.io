                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurgan_hypothesis"><b><u>Kurgan hypothesis</u></b></a> describes how the Indo-European (PIE) languages spread out throughout Europe and parts of Asia. (The less popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_hypothesis"><b><u>Anatolian hypothesis</u></b></a> suggests that PIE speakers lived in Anatolia during the Neolithic era and began to spread into Europe from around 7000 BC with the advance of farming.)

              <li>
                 According to the Kurgan hypothesis, one group of <a href="https://www.historyfiles.co.uk/FeaturesFarEast/CentralAsia_IndoEuropeans01.htm"><b><u>Indo-Europeans</u></b></a> began to move southwards in the 3rd cent BC. This became the Anatolian branch. Among these were the ancestors of the Hittites. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Then, around 3000 BC, more Indo-Europeans groups began moving east and west. Those in the west are identified with the Germanic, Italic (Latin), Celtic, and Hellenic (Greek) language branches, among others. Those in the east are identified with the Indian (Sanskrit) and Iranian branches.

                The Yamnaya culture is identified with the late Proto-Indo-Europeans. <a href="https://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-europe/yamnaya-culture-0012105><u>More.</u></a>

                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamnaya_culture"><b><u>Yamnaya culture</u></b></a> inhabited the Pontiac Steppes (Eastern Europe) circa 3300â€“2600 BC.
              </li>
              <li>
                 They buried their dead in pits (yama) beneath kurgans, which are a type of tumuli or mound. 
              </li>
              <li>
                 The Yamnaya were a semi-nomadic people, who used ox-drawn carts and wagons. There is also evidence that they rode horses. These technologies may have made them relatively mobile.
