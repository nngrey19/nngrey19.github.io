                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamnaya_culture"><u>Yamnaya culture</u></a> inhabited the Pontiac Steppes (Eastern Europe) circa 3300â€“2600 BC.
              </li>
              <li>
                 Their name derives from their burial tradition that means 'related to pits (yama)'. They buried their dead in pits beneath kurgans, a type of tumuli or mound. 
              </li>
              <li>
                 They were a semi-nomadic people, who used oxen-drawn carts and wagons, and there is evidence that they rode horses. These technologies may have made them relatively mobile.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Yamnaya culture is identified with the late Proto-Indo-Europeans.

                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurgan_hypothesis"><u>Kurgan hypothesis</u></a> describes how the Indo-European languages spread out throughout Europe and parts of Asia.

                Around 4000 BC one group of <a href="https://www.historyfiles.co.uk/FeaturesFarEast/CentralAsia_IndoEuropeans01.htm"><u>Indo-Europeans</u></a> began to move southwards. This became the Anatolian branch. Among these were the ancestors of the Hittites. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Around 3000 BC more Indo-Europeans groups began moving east and west. Those in the west are identified with the Germanic, Italic (Latin), Celtic, and Hellenic (Greek) language branches, among others. Those in the east are identified with the Indian (Sanskrit) and Iranian branches.
