                The Indo-Europeans (IEs) were the most widely ranging ethnic group in ancient times. Due to their existence on the steppes as cattle and horse raising people, they were quite mobile.

                Around 4000 BC one group of IEs began to move southwards. This became the Anatolian branch. Among these were the ancestors of the Hittites. The remainder moved north into the area that is now Ukraine.

                Around 3000 BC more IEs began moving east and west. Those in the west became the Germanic, Italic (Latin), Celtic, and Hellenic (Greek) language branches, among others. Those in the east became the Indian (Sanskrit) and Iranian branches.
