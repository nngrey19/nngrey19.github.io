              Anne and Sheru and I went on a hike near Round Lake today in search of the the Camas Lily fields. It was a wet adventure (this year has been unusually rainy) but we soldiered on, and after following a twisting path up the hill from the main trail, over a pretty little creek that was rushing with the rain, and finally over the crest of the hill, we were successful. Here are the lilies!
