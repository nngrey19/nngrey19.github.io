              I am in India visiting Anne's mom. Unfortunately, I got Covid en route, so my visit has started with a period of isolation. Luckily, the infection itself has been pretty tame - not much different than a mild cold. Still, I am concerned about passing it to Anne's mom, who is 85. We were pretty careful when I first arrived - wearing masks and social distancing - and I have been isolating in my room since testing positive. I probably should have isolated from the start, but I really didn't think I would get Covid after four doses of vaccine, a N95 mask, distancing from crowds and a seat in a fairly empty business section on the plane. Now, I know better.

              I finished Patrick O'Brian's fifth installment of the Aubrey-Maturin series, <i>Desolation Island</i>. I think it is the best yet.

              I had set a goal to read several books on this trip - <i>The Aeneid</i>, <i>The Inferno</i>, <i>Ulysses</i>, and <i>Swann's Way</i>. That was overly ambitious to begin with and my commitment has wavered as I convalesce. Nonetheless, I have made it through six chapters of <i>The Aeneid</i>, so I should at least complete one item.
