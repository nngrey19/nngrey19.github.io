              I am in India visiting Anne's mom. Unfortunately, I got Covid en route. So far it has been pretty tame - much like a mild cold. The greatest danger is giving it to Anne's mom who is 85. We were pretty careful after I arrived - wearing masks and keeping distance - and I have been isolating since testing positive. I probably should have isolated initially, but I really did not think I would get Covid after four doses of vaccine and a seat in a fairly empty business section on the plane. Now, I know better.

              I finished Patrick O'Brian's fifth installment of the Aubrey-Maturin series, <i>Desolation Island</i>. I think it was the best yet.

              I had set a goal to read several books on this trip - <i>The Aeneid</i>, <i>The Inferno</i>, <i>Ulysses</i>, and <i>Swann's Way</i>. That was over ambitious and my commitment is wavering as I convalesce, but I have made it through several chapters of <i>The Aeneid</i>, so I should at least complete it.
