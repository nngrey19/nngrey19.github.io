              It is the 200th anniversary of Percy Bysshe Shelley death, who drowned at age 29. Below is a painting of his cremation by Louis Ã‰douard Fournier. The painting is a wishful recreation of the event, which was far less romantic according to this <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2022/07/percy-bysshe-shelley-laureate-love-revolution" target="_blank"><u>story</u></a>.

               Beethoven's Missa Solemnis is highly regarded by many but I'm still not sure. As with much Beethoven, I find myself struggling with the sturm und drang. Maybe it will grow on me. I am generally fond of choral works.
