              I have been enjoying the new season of <i>Now Hear This</i> hosted by Scott Yoo. (<i>Now Hear This</i> is part of PBS's Great Performances series.) The latest episode is entitled new American Voices and it featured Reena Esmail, an Indian American composer, who incorporates elements of Indian music (especially Ragas) in her classical compositions. Her <a href="https://youtu.be/0wY1ynb3Pfc" target="_blank"><b><u>Piano Trio<a/></b></u> was featured on the show.

              I finished Aamina Ahmad's <i>The Return of Faraz Ali</i>. It is a solid novel with a powerful ending. Although I found it a bit depressing, it did hint at the possibility of redemption and the human urge to survive and find happiness. I often find myself being irritated at novels that aren't more uplifting, but I should probably be grateful that my life is not as difficult as the characters in the book.
