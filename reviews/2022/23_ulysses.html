              I finally "finished" Ulysses. I could not bring myself to read it word for word. I will leave that for Joyce fanatics and  masochists. My process was more like skim-reading with a review of various online summaries. I have no idea why this is a towering work of modernist fiction. It feels more like a series of gimmicks - one for each chapter. Do the gimmicks add anything important? I could not tell. I am glad I finally gave the book a shot and am even more glad that it is now in the rearview mirror.

              The latest episode of This Classical Life featured Maya Youssef. Youssef plays the qanun, 78-stringed Middle Eastern plucked zither. That in itself is intriguing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ptXZhuj_56U" target="_blank"><u>Here</u></a> is a sample of her music.

              Although I am a big fan of the minimalism of Philip Glass, I don't know much about other minimalists, like John Adams. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ei1KhIFsYPw" target="_blank"><u>Shaking and Trembling</u></a> from Shaker Loops was a nice introduction to his work.

              <a href="https://youtu.be/pCHYS3b8BeY" target="_blank"><u>Elhob ?!</u></a> is a fun and eclectic mash up by Toufic Farroukh.

              Finally, here's the lovely and almost breathtaking <a href="https://youtu.be/J3QZd4KDNoU" target="_blank"><u>2nd movement</u></a> of Antonín Dvořák's Symphony No.9 In E Minor, Op.95 'From The New World'.
