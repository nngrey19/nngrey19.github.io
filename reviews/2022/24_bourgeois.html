              I get a weekly highlights email from the New Yorker. This week's email mentioned an exhibit of painting by Louise Bourgeois, a French sculptor who lived much of her life in New York. That probably would not have caught my attention, except that there was a reference to her spider sculptures.

              I think I saw one of these spiders for the first time at SFMOMA. They are quite distinctive to say the least. Here is an image of Maman, which is the largest and probably the most famous of these sculptures.
