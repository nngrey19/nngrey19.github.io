              I made decent progress on my studies this week. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I finished Anna Karenina. I have no excuses for taking months to read this novel. It is an engaging read and not nearly as philosophical as Dostoyevsky. That being said, most of the final section was, in fact, a philosophical digression, mixed up with Levin's epiphany about the purpose of life, which I never quite grasped (too bad, that would be useful).

              Next up, Kim Stanley Robinson's <i>Ministry for the Future</i>.

            <p>
              I listened to the BBC's Composer of the Week episode on Monteverdi several times. Besides writing Orfeo, the earliest opera still in performance, Monteverdi was a prolific madrigalist. The <a href="https://youtu.be/z3ZX5hFN-is" target="_blank"><u>Nymph's Lament</u></a> from his eighth book of madrigals is a popular example.
            </p>
            <p>
              This week's composer is Bach. This introduction from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach" target="_blank"><u>Wikipedia</u></a> gives you a sense of the breadth of his work:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              [Bach] is known for his orchestral music such as the Brandenburg Concertos; instrumental compositions such as the Cello Suites; keyboard works such as the Goldberg Variations and The Well-Tempered Clavier; organ works such as the Schubler Chorales and the Toccata and Fugue in D minor; and vocal music such as the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              He was also known for his cantatas. I gathered a little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantata" target="_blank"><u>background</u></a> on this form in an attempt to better understand it:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A [cantata is] a vocal composition with an instrumental accompaniment, typically in several movements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Italian solo cantata tended, when on a large scale, to become indistinguishable from a scene in an opera, in the same way the church cantata, solo or choral, is indistinguishable from a small oratorio or portion of an oratorio.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The term "cantata" changed over time, from the simple single-voice madrigal of the early 17th century, to the multi-voice "cantata da camera" and the "cantata da chiesa" of the later part of that century.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Prior to the 17th century, all "cultured" music was vocal. With the rise of instrumental music, there was a need to differentiate between the forms. The terms cantata (vocal) and sonata (instrumental) are among types of music popular at the time.
                </li>
                <li>There seems to be some overlap between the various vocal forms: motet, madrigal, cantata, opera and oratorio.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite his heavenly compositions, it turns out Bach was a bit of a grump. Here is a small digression on Bach's temperment and the word "mayhem," which I thought meant "chaos," but originally had a more legalistic sense and referred to "maiming, disabling, or disfiguring a person." More <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mayhem" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              From <u>The Lives of Great Composers</u>: 
              <blockquote>
                The upshot was that Bach drew his dagger and went for Geyserbach; and, in a trice, the future composer of the St. Matthew Passion was rolling on the ground, attempting mayhem on his opponent. p.4
              </blockquote>

              I fell a behind in art history but did make it through four chapters of the text. This <a href="https://smarthistory.org/bushel-with-ibex-motifs/" target="_blank"><u> beaker with ibex motifs</u></a> from Susa (Iran) is an amazing piece. I can't believe the abstract and stylized design employed on this 6000-year-old vessel. It is really mind-boggling. Earlier works, such as cave paintings, are not always realistic, but they do not seem as consciously crafted as this piece.
