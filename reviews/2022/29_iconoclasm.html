              The latest episode of The Week in Art podcast discusses the recent protest by Just Stop Oil, a British climate NGO. Two members of the group threw tomato soup on Van Gogh's Sunflowers to raise awareness about climate change. The painting is covered in glass and no harm was done.

              Ben Luke, the host of the podcast, interviewed Stacy Boldrick, an expert in iconoclasm. I had always thought the word iconoclasm meant something like rebellion and that an iconoclast was someone who broke the norms. This is not too far off from the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/iconoclast" target="_blank"><u>general sense</u></a> of the word, which is a person who attacks settled beliefs, but originally, an iconoclast was a person who destroyed religious images. There have been incidents of iconoclasm throughout history. Two of the most well known periods are during the reign of the Byzantine emperor Leo II and during the reformation.

            <blockquote>
               Holbein left Basel for London in 1532, likely impelled by a terror of rampaging iconoclasm—the wholesale destruction of religious imagery and artifacts by overenthusiastic Protestants in the Swiss city.
