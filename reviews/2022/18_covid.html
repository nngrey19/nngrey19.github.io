              I have had four doses of vaccine - two doses of Pfizer and two of Moderna. Yet despite my vaccination status and my attempts to be careful during my trip to India, I still caught Covid (probably one of the newer Omicron subvariants). I tested positive on June 1 (two days after arriving) using an at-home antigen test. I was actually symptomatic (congestion) at least a day earlier, but I did not want to believe I had caught the virus, and so I delayed testing.

              Two weeks later, on June 15, I am still testing positive using a home test. However, the line that indicates I am positive is quite faint, so I must be finally clearing the virus. Still, this seems like a long time to be testing positive, and it has raised the issue of whether or not I am still infectious. Probably not, but possibly. Honestly, no one seems to know for sure. I still have a light cough, but Anne's sister Susan said she had a cough for a month after contracting Covid, so that may or may not be another sign of infectiousness. I guess this is the world we live in now.
