              I have finished Swann's Way, the first installment of Marcel Proust's seven-volume novel <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>. Anyone who actually gets through all seven volumes deserves a medal, in my opinion. It is not an easy book to stick with. There is nothing terribly complicated about the writing or the ideas that are developed. The tough part is following the long winding sentences that attempt to capture some minute detail from start to finish. There is a sort of philosophical descriptiveness that is admirable (I guess) but exhausting.

              On top of this, I am not sure how the reader is supposed to respond to the narrator and to Swann. Should we find them admirable in their sensitivity and taste or are they caricatures of the petit bourgeoisie? My initial sympathies turned to irritation and dislike as these characters slipped into self-absorption, affectation and indulgence (much like aunt LÃ©onie and her affliction).

              Honestly, I have to wonder if I have any real literary sensitivity or critical aptitude, given my lack of appreciation for a work that is regarded a pillar of literary achievement.
