              I have finished Swann's Way, the first installment of Marcel Proust's seven-volume novel <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>. Anyone who actually gets through all seven volumes deserves a medal in my opinion. It is not an easy book to stick with. There is nothing terribly complicated about the writing or the ideas that are developed. The challenge is following the long, winding sentences, which attempt to capture some a thought or feeling in minute detail, from start to finish. Proust engages in a sort of philosophical descriptiveness that is impressive (I guess) but exhausting.

              On top of this, I am not sure how the reader is supposed to respond to the narrator or to Swann. Should we find them admirable in their sensitivity and taste or are they overly delicate? My initial sympathies turned to irritation and dislike as these characters slipped into self-absorption, affectation and indulgence (much like aunt LÃ©onie and her affliction).

              Honestly, I have to wonder if I have any real literary sensitivity or critical aptitude, given my lack of appreciation for a work that is so highly regarded.
