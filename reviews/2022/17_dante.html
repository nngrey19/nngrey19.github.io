              I finished the <i>Inferno</i> and glanced through the <i>Purgatorio</i> and <i>Paradiso</i>. The Inferno is engaging in a morbid fashion. Dante was that kid in school who spent too much time trying to imitate H.R. Giger. Cool, weird but also kind of icky. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I also finished Kim Stanley Robinson's <i>2312</i>. Robinson remains one of my favorite science fiction writers. His vision of the future is very convincing, despite the somewhat dull plotting of his stories.

              I have quite run across several intriguing musical pieces. The Idagio newsletter featured Max Richter's version of The Four Seasons (<i>Recomposed</i>, 2021), where he reprises, his interpretation of Vivaldi, this time using period instruments. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Next up is Benjamin Britten's stunning <i>Four Sea Interludes</i>, which originally appeared as part of his opera Peter Grimes. I heard this on a lovely new podcast I have discovered: BBC's Record Review. Each episode considers several different recordings of a piece and selects the "best" one. In this case, the winner was Edward Gardner and the BBC Philharmonic (2010).

              Finally, the latest episode of This Classical Life featured Brazilian guitarist Plínio Fernandes. Among the pieces that were featured were three that caught my attention:
              <ul> 
                <li>
                  Heitor Villa-Lobos - Bachianas Brasileiras No. 4, W.424; IV. Danza (Michael Tilson Thomas, New World Symphony), mainly because I have no familiarity with Villa-Lobos and I thought it was time to learn a little more.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Beethoven - <a href="https://youtu.be/7-vMP8eTLXw" target="_blank"><u>Bagatelles</a></u>, Op. 33: V. Allegro, ma non troppo</a></u></b>, because this is not really what I expect Beethoven to sound like. This is a lovely piece with none of the sturm and drang I generally associate with Romanticism.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Johann Sebastian Bach – O Jesu Christ, mein’s Lebens Licht Motet, <a href="https://youtu.be/c2OILc6Wl0E" target="_blank"><u><b>BWV 118</a></u></b>, because, well,  because I really love Bach.
                </li>
              </ul> 
            </p>
