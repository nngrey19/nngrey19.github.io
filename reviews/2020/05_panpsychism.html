              Panpsychism is the idea that all material things have an some element of mental activity or consciousness. In some ways, this is an appealing idea, just as the Christian notion of eternal life is appealing. Perhaps, when I die, I do not completely lose this consciousness of mine. Perhaps, it continues in a less active state - a sleepy consciousness - or it is transformed into some other type of consciousness.*

            <p>
              Of course, it is also a little frightening to imagine that all things might have some element of consciousness and that I have taken this - them - for granted all my life. It reminds me a bit of "The Secret Lives of Plants" and my fear that I have been abusing my garden vegetables.

              One way to think about the notion of panpsychism is to consider consciousness on a continuum with humans (probably) at the top. Next, comes primates or whales. They are quite smart and probably not all that different from humans in the grand scale of things. They probably have a degree of self-consciousness and obviously have many other mental qualities. Then other smart animals pigs, dogs, crows, etc. Next, the not so smart animals. Reptiles, perhaps, or fish. Do they have self-consciousness? I'm not sure. They definitely have a picture of the world around them. They probably process stimuli in some more enlightened manner than machines. Now, incests, worms, small celled animals. Again, they react to stimuli so there is something there. What about when we pass to plants and then to things that live on the border of life like viruses.

              We can speculate that there are levels of consciousness as we take these steps "down" the ladder of life. But is there a point when consciousness winks out? When life becomes little more than biological machines? The panpsychists say no. Consciousness just diminishes, it never goes away completely.
            </p>
            <p>
              My biggest issue with this idea is based on my own experience. When I go to sleep - into a deep dreamless sleep - I lose consciousness. There are big chunks of time each night when there is nothing there at all. If consciousness remains in me somewhere, it is like my subconsciousness, a state that I have no access to or memory of. A thing that is nothing to me. What kind of consciousness is that? If I can experience a state that appears to be the complete opposite of consciousness, what would make believe that inanimate objects partake of something greater than my own deep sleep?
            </p>
            <p>
              Any consciousness that is at such a low level to be imperceptible seems not to be consciousness to me.

              * I'm not sure if this would be a consciousness attached to my dead body or a consciousness of all things that are not live bodies. I'm not sure if it would have any attachment to or memory of my old consciousness.
