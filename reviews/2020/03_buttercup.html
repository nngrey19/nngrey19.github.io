              Today's flower is the <a href="https://wildflowersearch.org/search?oldstate=title%3AWashington+Park+Wildflowers%3Bgmc%3A45.512%2C-122.718%3Bgloc%3A161%2C285%3Blocation%3AWashington+Park%2C+Portland%3Belev%3A800%3Bgms%3A12%3B&buttonName=none&hab=&Elev=&PlantName=&S__18642.x=84&S__18642.y=80" target="_blank"><b><u>Creeping Buttercup</u></b></a>. We observed it in several spots along the forest branch of the MAC Trail during our midday walk. It is not a showy flower but it is prolific. I suspect it can be found throughout the park and city.

              After a little research, I learned that the flower is native to Europe, Asia and northwestern Africa and is generally viewed as invasive in the U.S. It is a stoloniferous plant, meaning it has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolon" target="_blank"><b><u>stolons</u></b></a> or runners, which are stems that grow close the ground and form roots.
