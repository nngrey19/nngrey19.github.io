              Opera is about drama. The sets and costumes are big, bold and heroic. The voices are as well. Opera awes and overwhelms. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Musicals are a popular version of opera. They has all the same attributes, but a somewhat more accessible vocabulary. 
            </p>

              Ballet and modern dance are about athleticism. Powerful bodies and beautiful form. Dance lies at the crossroads of athletics and art.

              Theater is about intellect and empathy. Theater forces you to confront and grapple with ideas and values and human interactions. Much of theater happens after the performance is over.
            </p>
            <p>
              The novel is also an intellectual engagement but one that is carried by narrative and decorated with poetry. 
            </p>

              The symphony, chamber music, and instrumental music in general are abstract, intuitive, immersive and sublime. Music is not a thinking experience, it is a feeling experience. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Poetry, like instrumental music, is experienced in the moment. It may have an epiphanic element or a sense of symmetry or closure. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The visual arts are both reflective and introspective. Our engagement with them makes us conscious of the other and thereby conscious of the self. They are symbolic, artifactual and aspirational.
