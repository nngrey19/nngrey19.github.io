              At the Getty Villa, there were a large assortment of ancient oil and perfume containers made of glass and terracotta. I was struck by these everyday objects because they were utilitarian in their day and yet now have taken on the special significance of an artifact. Once trivial, now remarkable. To be fair, some of these objects were highly decorated and may have been prized by their owners, but still they lived more in the realm of craft than art and served relatively mundane purposes.

            <p>
              Looking that these objects made me wonder about the barriers of time and body. When I gaze on an artifact like this, I often succumb to the illusion that I am closer to the time when it was used and to the people who used it. I picture them (or even myself) in a room holding the object, dabbing oil on my fingers or pouring it into a vessel, and I feel like I am transported a bit into that world. And yet there is so much distance between this illusion and fact.

              A few seconds is an amount of time that feels real and measurable, ten minutes is as well, but yesterday? I remember where I was about this time yesterday, but there were so many moments between now and then and most of these I experienced through the limited and day-dreamy consciousness that is my everyday experience and many of these I have forgotten already. A week? A year? These are units of time that I can define, but I do not understand them in terms of my experience. I can recall a few highlights, but even these are partial. And even if I could remember them in greater detail, there is a profound difference between a lived experience and the memory of that experience -- the thing and a simulacrum of the thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              And now, too, I must step into the mind of another. How do I do that? I assume I understand something about the thoughts of the people I know well. I know a little about what makes them happy and angry, but there is no way for me to experience these emotions as them. I can say to myself that this makes her happy, and when I am happy, I feel like this, and so she must feel something akin. But it is also possible that if I could somehow slip into another's mind and see the world as they do while still understanding the world as me, the two would be at odds and perhaps irreconcilable. Her blue would be my green, the logical connections would be reversed, the impressions of the world around us would be far more detailed and perceptive or much less so, her sense of well-being and joy would be wholly unexpected.

            <p>
              And what of the people I do not know, those sitting on the plane behind me or living their lives on the ground below me or dead now for several generations, so that no living soul remembers they existed. How could I possibly know and feel the things they did in the way they did? And how do I travel back 2000 years to a room in Athens or Corinth or on Crete and reach for an oil container and feel the thoughts and emotions of another in a time and place so distant as to be practically fantastic and in any meaningful way inhabit that moment?
