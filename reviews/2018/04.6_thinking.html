              When I am conscious, I think. This thinking takes different forms -- day dreaming, watching TV, trying to fix a broken light switch. The constancy and pervasiveness of thinking make it a process that is difficult to be objective about. You can't get outside of it to look at it. But let's try.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, I have some assumptions about my thinking that are largely unquestioned. I assume my thinking is related to the world around me. When my body tells me it is hungry and I begin to wonder what I might eat, I recall the oranges in the fruit basket. My recollection is of a thing in the world that can satisfy my hunger.
            </p>
            <p>
              So in one way my brain is like a memoir or a photo album. I record some experiences, like the memory of fruit in a basket. The recording -- a kind of fuzzy visual representation -- points to something in the world, just as words on a page or images in a photo album point to things in the real world. It is a symbol.
            </p>
            <p>
              (Of course, my brain can do more than simply recall previous experiences. It can combine past experiences into new ideas, it can plan, problem-solve and it can imagine among other things.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's dig a little deeper. What is it I do when I think about a thing?
            </p>
            <p>
              First of all, let's consider the jumbled process that is regular consciousness. If you have ever tried to meditate, you have probably been struck by the jumble of random thoughts and tangential connections that emerge in your mind. It quickly becomes apparent that the normal thought process is not linear and logical. It is much more like the stream of consciousness that we encounter when reading Joyce's Ulysses. A line of thought begins and then moves sideways some tangential matter and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              But what happens when I do manage to concentrate on a single idea? When I think about the orange, I recall a fuzzy image of the orange. What about a less concrete entity? When I think about the concept of acceleration, for example, I might do one of the following. I might say the word to myself (this is what I generally do) and the word alone carries a great deal of meaning to me, perhaps because of past associations or usage. I might also try to define the concept of acceleration using other words like "increasing speed". Or I might imagine the process visually. I can picture in my mind the image of a car rolling down a hill. If I was a physicist, I could probably also describe acceleration mathematically.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm not sure what these ways of thinking about acceleration have to do with the thing itself. Again, I suppose they are symbolic pointers that refer to an activity that happens frequently in the real world. But they are not the activity. They do not suggest that the activity is taking place now or in the immediate vicinity of the pointer. We tend to believe that a symbol and the thing it symbolizes have a connection -- perhaps a close connection -- because of this referential relationship. But what exactly is that relationship, where does it exist?
            </p>
            <p>
              What I am trying to get at here is that there are things in the world and ideas in my head. I have a sense that I live in the world but do I? Is my experience of the world largely mediated through my thoughts? (I suppose this link if thinking is going down the path of idealism and phenomenology.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Returning to the orange, how do I think about it. Again, I can say the word to myself or picture an orange-colored fist-sized piece of fruit. (I'm not sure what fist-sized means when I picture an object in my mind, since size is a relative concept and there is nothing exists in my mind relative to the orange.) The concept in my head matches certain superficial characteristics of a thing in a certain place and time in the real world -- round, orange colored, dimpled skin, perhaps an associated memory of an orange smell.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the real world, however, the orange is much more than the static image in my mind. It exists in time, growing from a small bud on a tree to a mature fruit and continuing on to go bad in the basket if I do not consume it. It is the orange flesh and juice and seeds that are not part of this memory (but might be part of another memory of eating an orange). It is an entity with characteristics that my senses don't capture, like mass and gravitational pull.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of which bring me to the fact that the belief that my thoughts correspond to the world is a bit of an illusion. My thoughts are more like data points that tell me as much about the world as I need to survive in it. I don't need to understand the gravitational pull of an orange to eat it, but I just need to recollect its location and the fact that it is edible.
