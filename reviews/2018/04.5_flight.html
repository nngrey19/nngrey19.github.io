              Recently, I have thinking about perceptions -- that is, my access to sensory information and my ability to process that information. I sometime feel a bit like the man in [Descartes theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_theater), peering out through my eyeballs and listening at my ear drums to the proximate stimuli around me. It can feel very limited.

              Right now I am sitting on a plane at 33,000 feet. I have a partially obstructed view of the dim fuselage before me, the mingled sound of jet engines and rushing air in my ears, and the feel of the keyboard beneath my fingers. I have no immediate knowledge of the stars above or the coldness of the air outside or what lies in the blackness at the horizons. These things are ostensibly out there, but they are not accessible to me.

              The pilots in their cockpit have access to various instruments that provide human understandable information about speed and altitude and location. However, they are unable to sense these things directly. The don't see or sense the altitude. They see a dial that shows them a number that signifies the altitude.

              One day in the not too distant future we will use machines (glasses and gloves and perhaps even implants) that will increase the information we can access. Perhaps, this supplemental information will be overlaid on existing perceptions (heads up displays), or perhaps new streams of information will be accessible to us on additional channels, or perhaps these machines will help our brains process more information in ways that our minds alone are unable to. Will this lead to a new type of consciousness, one that makes our current consciousness seem primitive or like a qualitatively different and lesser state?            <p>
              The instrumentation for Waltonâ€™s piece is quite large, including a robust contingent of brass and percussion. It is a lovely and joyful piece, but I kept thinking it sounded like a movie score. This is not a bad thing - John William's creates lovely large scale works - just unexpected. I suspect that orchestras that perform movie scores are large in order to create the greatest possible dramatic effect and this larger instrumentation creates a unique sound that is full and lush. I am sure there is a lot more too it but this was my initial reaction.
