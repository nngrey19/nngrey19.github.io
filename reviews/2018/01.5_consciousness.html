              The term consciousness has several distinct meanings.
            </p>
            <p>
              We compare conscious and unconscious states - being awake and aware versus being asleep or sedated.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also use the term to describe an awareness of things around us -- the sound of a car alarm or the effect of a person entering the room. We become conscious of the presence of these things.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am conscious of sensations. I see, hear, feel, taste and smell things. And I am conscious of states of my body: hot, cold, tired.
            </p>
            <p>
              I experience common emotions such as fear, satisfaction, happiness, anger, attraction, and others, less frequent but equally distinct: curiosity, wonder, ennui.
            </p>
            <p>
              I process information. I can act on my sensations, putting on a coat when I am cold or eating when I am hungry. I imagine and create, which is involves creating new thoughts and ideas from existing ones. I calculate, read, communicate. These are all conscious acts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, we use consciousness to describe self-awareness -- the knowledge that I am the thing experiencing all these thoughts and sensations, the belief that I exist.
            </p>
            <p>
              A thermostat reacts to hot and cold, but it does not know that it does so (one assumes). It has no interior life. If I shiver in my sleep and pull up the blanket, I am living the life of a thermostat. But if I am awake, the sense or hot and cold exist in relation to me. I am hot or cold.
            </p>
            <p> 
              I place value on my consciousness. I want to maintain it. It is precious to me. I sleep peacefully at night knowing that consciousness will return in the morning, but I fear death because it will separate me permanently from this precious state. In fact, it is possible that consciousness exists -- that it has found an ongoing usefulness - because it confers an evolutionary advantage -- the desire to be and to continue to be.
