              Last night, we attended the Oregon Symphony performance of Stravinsky’s ballet Petrushka. Petruska was preceded by several pieces, including Haydn’s Drumroll Symphony and a piece by William Walton to mark Johannesburg’s 70th anniversary – the Johannesburg Festival Overture. 
            <p>
              The instrumentation for Walton’s piece is quite large, including a robust contingent of brass and percussion. It is a lovely and joyful piece, but I kept thinking it sounded like a movie score. This is not a bad thing - John William's creates lovely large scale works - just unexpected. I suspect that orchestras that perform movie scores are large in order to create the greatest possible dramatic effect and this larger instrumentation creates a unique sound that is full and lush. I am sure there is a lot more too it but this was my initial reaction.
            </p>

              My other reaction to the evening’s line up had to do with Haydn. We often hear Haydn performed by the Portland Baroque Orchestra, and it is lovely, but sometimes the anachronistic interpretations of a classical orchestra are just as good or even better.
