              This past weekend, Anne and I saw two performances at the SF Opera -- Strauss' Arabella and Puccini's Tosca. While we thoroughly enjoyed Tosca, Arabella was a pretty dull affair. Our different reactions had nothing to do with the quality of the performances. We are not expert enough to know if a major company's performance is good or bad. To our ears, the singers and orchestra were outstanding in both cases.

              I think the issue has to do primarily with Strauss' style and secondarily with the operas' subject matter. With regard to style, I would describe Arabella as sung drama. The opera does not seem designed to highlight song. Song is simply the vehicle for the story. It is almost as though the performers were handed a spoken play and told to sing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tosca, by comparison, seems more like a vehicle to elevate and celebrate song. Arias are the main attraction, recitative exists to get us to the next one. While Arabella had a moment or two - I was particularly struck by a duet between Arabella and her sister in the first act - we soon realized we were in for a long, slow evening.
            </p>
            <p>
              The subject matter of each opera also differed dramatically. Arabella is the story of a rich girl, who experiences a bit of trouble finalizing her engagement to one of her rich suitors. Our heroine is not unlikable, our hero slightly less so. In comparison, Tosca starts with a prison break and is followed by arrests, torture, attempted rape, murder, disguised murder and suicide. It has villains, heroes and heroines all set against the backdrop of war and revolution. It is a melodrama in the very best sort of way. A guilty pleasure studded with gorgeous song.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is our second Strauss opera - the first being Ariadne auf Naxos at the Santa Fe Opera Festival - and our second disappointment. Nor were we alone in our feelings if the dwindling crowd at the War Memorial Opera House was any indication. What I find most interesting about this experience is that a highly celebrated company would mount an opera that would be so challenging for the audience. There must be a reason.
            </p>
            <p>
              People who really understand opera must feel that Arabella is worth performing. Why would you pick something not worth performing when you can only stage six shows a season? It makes no sense. There must be something about Strauss' style and his creations that merits attention. I honestly hope I will understand what it is one day.
