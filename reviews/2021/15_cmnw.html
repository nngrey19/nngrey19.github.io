              Tonight, accompanied by Patrick and Diane, I attended my first "post-pandemic" event: Chamber Music Northwest's summer festival finale. Unfortunately, this may also have been my last event for awhile, since we are seeing a rise in Covid cases again, largely associated with the Delta variant. Diane and Patrick David joined me. Anne is still stuck in India, but we got to chat with her on the phone after the concert.

              The program was entitled "Reflecting on the Classic" and featured:
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Bach, Prelude in F Minor, BWV 881 (arranged for quartet by Mark Steinberg)</li>
                <li>Haydn, String Quartet in F Minor, Op. 20, No. 5</li>
                <li>Barber, Dover Beach</li>
                <li>Brahms, Piano Trio No. 2 in C Major, Op.87</li>
              </ul>
            <p>
              The artists include The Brentano Quartet (Mark Steinberg, violin, Serena Canin, violin, Misha Amory, viola, Nina Lee, cello), Gloria Chien, Soovin Kim, Paul Watkins, and Davóne Tines.
            </p>

              Not surprisingly, given my penchant for Baroque-era music, I very much enjoyed the Bach and Haydn. The Barber featured a sung version of Matthew Arnold's Dover Beach. The singer, Davóne Tines, had an impressive and powerful voice. I thought it overwhelmed the strings, although it could have been the acoustics or my ignorance. The Brahms was quite dramatic, but still enjoyable.
