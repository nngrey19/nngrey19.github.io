              I finished The ABC Murders by Agatha Christie. I never warmed up to the it. I suspect the classic mystery genre just does not work for me. My mom used to love Agatha Christie novels. Arthur Conan Doyle too. But these stories just fall flat for me. The style is very formulaic, not in a lazy, derivative way, but purposefully. The formula - the crime, the investigation, and the denouement, where the real killer is revealed - is a prized feature of the genre. For whatever reason, I find it dull. Oh well, I have made an effort and confirmed that this is not for me.
