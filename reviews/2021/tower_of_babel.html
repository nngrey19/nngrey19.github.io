              Yesterday, I started a new podcast called <a href="https://literatureandhistory.com/index.php"><i>Literature and History</i></a>. The first episode was about the biblical "Tower of Babel" story. Doug Metzger, the podcaster, believes the story is an allegory for the rise of alphabets and the decline of cuneiform as a unifying linguistic medium. It is a very nice theory, although I am not sure there is enough evidence to confirm or deny it.

              While I wasn't totally convinced by the episode's primary thesis, I was very pleased with some of the background material. I am quite embarrassed to have been largely clueless about the historicity of several biblical events and the timeline of writing the Old Testament. This episode and a little research set me straight.

              The Old Testament was written and assembled by different individuals over hundreds of years. The earliest writings probably date from the 8th-7th centuries BC. These writings are roughly contemporaneous with the writing of the Iliad and the Odyssey. More <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_the_Bible">here</a>.

              A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_literalist_chronology#Egypt_to_the_Exodus_1914%E2%80%931577_BCE">literalist timeline</a> of the bible dates the birth of Moses to  1657 BC and the flight from Egypt to 1577 BC. However, biblical archeology can find no evidence to suggest that the Israelites were ever enslaved in Egypt. Instead, the events of Exodus probably derive from the Babylon exile in the 6th century BC. Aside from the broad themes of exile and enslavement, the events of Exodus, including the figure of Moses, are best understood as myth.

            <p>The word "Babel" refers to the city of Babylon and some scholars have suggested that the Tower of Babylon may refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel">Etemenanki</a>, a ziggurat about 50 miles south of present-day Baghdad.
