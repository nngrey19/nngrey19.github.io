              I listened to the story of <a href="https://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr1823.htm" target="_blank"><u>Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta</u></a>, which is featured in the first episode of the <a href="https://oldeststories.wordpress.com/"><u>Oldest Stories podcast</u></a>. It is a little early to render judgement on the podcast; however, I am glad that someone is trying to highlight this material and I plan on listening to more episodes before making any assessments. This particular story was noteworthy because it offers an explanation for the invention of writing - namely, that it was too hard for the king's messenger to remember everything. The podcast lists <a href="https://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/index1.htm"><u>The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature</u></a> as a resource. This seems to be an important repository of materials.
