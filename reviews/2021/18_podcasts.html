              I have been dabbling in several podcasts and books over the last few weeks. At the top of this list is one of my favorites, Literature and History. I have made it through several more episodes, and I have to say it is a very well done production. These latest episodes focus on the Old Testament, and are grouped according to the four main sections of the Bible, the Pentateuch, the Historical Books, the Poetic and Wisdom Books, and the Prophetic Books.

              I have listened to several episode of the <a href="https://ancientworldpodcast.com/">Ancient World podcast</a>. It is not quite as polished and engaging and Literature and History, but it includes some helpful overviews of periods and peoples.

              I have listened to a few chapters of Andrew Roberts, <i>Napoleon, a Life</i>. I'm not sure how much farther I will get with this book. It is not always as objective as I would like.

              I have read several chapters of Tom Holland's <i>Rubicon</i>. So far, it has provided a pretty high level overview of Rome's early history. We'll see if it provides useful detail of the end of the Republic.

              Finally, I ran across a <a href="https://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/201/great_books_etexts.html">website</a> that contains several lists of the Western Canon. I love this stuff, despite it being out of favor.
