              I have been dabbling in several podcasts and books over the last few weeks. At the top of the list is one of my favorites, Literature and History. I have made it through several more episodes and continue to be thoroughly impressed with this well done production. The latest episodes focus on the Old Testament and are grouped according to the four main sections of the Bible: the Pentateuch, the Historical Books, the Poetic and Wisdom Books, and the Prophetic Books.

              I have listened to several episode of the <a href="https://ancientworldpodcast.com/"><u>Ancient World podcast</u></a>. It is not quite as polished and engaging and Literature and History, but it includes some helpful overviews of periods and peoples.

              I have listened to a few chapters of Andrew Roberts, Napoleon, a Life. I'm not sure how much farther I will get with this book. It can be opinionated in places and I am beginning to believe it is inferior to the <a href="https://ageofnapoleon.com/"><u>Age of Napoleon</u></a> podcast.

              I have read several chapters of Tom Holland's Rubicon. So far, it has provided a pretty high level overview of Rome's early history. We'll see if it becomes more focused as it shifts to the period that marks the end of the Republic.

              Finally, I ran across this <a href="https://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/201/great_books_etexts.html"><u>website</u></a> that contains several lists of the Western Canon. I love this stuff, despite it being out of favor.
