              I am listening to course lectures for Yale's <a href="https://oyc.yale.edu/classics/clcv-205" target="_blank"><u>Introduction to Ancient Greek History</u></a> taught by Donald Kagan. It is a very traditional introduction to the material. I am supplementing the lecture with readings from Ancient Greece by Thomas Martin.

              I finished these lectures on July 24. I have to say that I really enjoyed them. There was a lot of material and only part of it sank in, but at least, I know have a mental outline of the period and a foundation for future explorations of its history, literature and art.
