              Yesterday, I started a new podcast called <a href="https://literatureandhistory.com/index.php" target="_blank"><u>Literature and History</u></a>. The first episode discussed the biblical Tower of Babel story. Doug Metzger, the podcaster, believes this story is an allegory for the rise of alphabets and the decline of cuneiform as a unifying linguistic medium. It is a very nice theory, although I am not sure there is enough evidence to confirm or deny it.

              While I wasn't totally convinced by the episode's primary thesis, I was very pleased with podcast's overall treatment of the subject. I am embarrassed to admit I was largely clueless about the historicity of several biblical events as well as the timeline of writing the Old Testament. This episode, and a little independent research, set me straight.

              The Old Testament was written and assembled by different individuals over hundreds of years. The earliest sections of the Old Testament probably date from the 8th-7th centuries BC. These passages were written down about the same time as the Iliad and the Odyssey. More <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_the_Bible" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.

              A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_literalist_chronology#Egypt_to_the_Exodus_1914%E2%80%931577_BCE"><u>literalist timeline</u></a> of the bible dates the birth of Moses to  1657 BC and the flight from Egypt to 1577 BC. However, archeologists can find no evidence that the Israelites were ever enslaved in Egypt. Instead, the events of Exodus probably derive from the Babylon exile in the 6th century BC. Aside from the broad themes of exile and enslavement, the book of Exodus, including its central figure Moses, is best understood as myth.

              The word "Babel" refers to the city of Babylon and some scholars have suggested that the Tower of Babylon may refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel" target="_blank"><u>Etemenanki</u></a>, a ziggurat about 50 miles south of present-day Baghdad.
