              <a href="http://www.tinethinghelseth.com/"><u>Tine Thing Helseth</u></a> is a Norwegian trumpeter.  She and organist KÃ¥re Nordstoga released a new album "Magical Memories" on May 28, 2021. The album includes a variety of works set for trumpet and organ. It was recorded in Oslo Cathedral during lockdown.

              I have never heard settings for trumpet and organ. It is a pleasant, if surprising. pairing.

              The trumpet takes the lead throughout the album. It is bright and clear, and serves as the main melodic line. The organ is more discrete and lush, and largely offers harmony or counterpoint. The music is often light, but a number of the songs are melancholy. I was surprised by the trumpet's ability to capture that mood.
