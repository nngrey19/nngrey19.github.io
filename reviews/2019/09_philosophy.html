              The earliest Greek philosophers are often called cosmologists or naturalists because they focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thales of Miletus is considered the first Greek philosopher because he was the first to give a purely natural explanation of the origin of the world, free from mythological ingredients. He held that everything had come out of water—an explanation based on the discovery of fossil sea animals far inland.
            </p>
            <p>
              The atomist Leucippus believed there are two fundamental principles of the physical world, empty space and filled space — the latter consisting of atoms. Democritus built an explanation of the varied phenomena of the world based on its atomic structure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pythagoras of Samos argued that the essence and structure of all things can be determined through numerical relations: "all things are numbers".
            </p>
            <p>
              The Sophists were skeptical of philosophical and cultural traditions. They concluded that most rules of conduct are conventions, since different nations have different rules for even the most sacred things — such as marriage and burial.
            </p>
            <p>
              In reaction to some of the theories of the cosmologists, the Sophist Protagoras of Abdera stated that “man is the measure of all things.” The world is what it appears to be to people, not something else.
            </p>
            <p>
              Socrates is sometimes called the first moral philosopher. He believed that nobody who really knows what is good and right could act against it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Plato believed that the things people perceive with their senses are imperfect copies of eternal Forms. In the myth of the cave (<i>The Republic</i>), Plato likened the ordinary person to a man sitting in a cave looking at a wall on which he sees nothing but the shadows of real things.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aristotle invented the discipline of logic. He is also the first author whose surviving works contain detailed and extensive observations of natural phenomena.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <i>Prior Analytics</i> is devoted to the theory of the syllogism: Every Greek is human. Every human is mortal. Therefore, every Greek is mortal.
            </p>
            <p>
              In <i>Posterior Analytics</i> Aristotle applies the syllogism to scientific ends. Scientific knowledge must be built from demonstrations. A demonstration is a particular kind of syllogism, one whose premises can be traced back to principles that are true, necessary, universal, and immediately intuited.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stoicism was founded by Zeno of Citium. He believed the path to eudaimonia (happiness) is found in accepting the moment as it is, by not being controlled by the desire for pleasure or fear of pain, by doing one's part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Epicureanism was founded by Zeno’s contemporary Epicurus. Epicurus made pleasure the essence of a happy life. However, he did not advocate dissolution and debauchery; he insisted that it is the simple pleasures that make a life happy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Skepticism was founded by another of Zeno’s contemporaries, Pyrrhon of Elis. Pyrrhon believed that no one can be certain that the things he perceives with his senses are real and not illusory.
            </p>
            <p>
              Philosophy of the medieval period was closely connected to Christianity. The chief philosophers of the period were churchmen.
            </p>
            <p>
              Augustine's thinking was influenced by the Neoplatonists. He believed that there is a spiritual, eternal realm of Truth, which he identified with God, beyond the world of the senses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through his translations, Boethius helped spread Aristotle's ideas. In his <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i>, he adopts the Platonic notion that there are innate ideas, and their origin is in the remembering of knowledge from a previous existence.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 12th century the old style of education, based on the liberal arts and emphasizing grammar and the reading of the Latin classics, was replaced by new methods stressing logic, dialectic, and all the scientific disciplines known at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Behold, everything was being renovated: grammar was being made over, logic was being remodeled, rhetoric was being despised. Discarding the rules of their predecessors, [the masters] were teaching the quadrivium with new methods taken from the very depths of philosophy. John of Salisbury (c. 1115–1180)
            </p>
            <p>
              For Thomas Aquinas reason and faith could not contradict each other, because they came from the same divine source. Conservative theologians and philosophers regarded Aristotle with suspicion and leaned toward the more traditional Christian Neoplatonism. Aquinas tried to show the essential soundness of Aristotle’s system and to convince his contemporaries of its value for Christian theology.
            </p>
            <p>
              The rise of secular power during the Renaissance stimulated the growth of political philosophy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Niccolò Machiavelli explored techniques for the seizure and retention of power.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thomas Hobbes argued that in the “state of nature” that preceded civilization, “every man’s hand [was] raised against every other” and human life was accordingly “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” A social contract was thus agreed upon to convey all private rights to a single sovereign in return for general protection and the institution of a reign of law.
            </p>
            <p>
              Materialism, idealism, rationalism, and empiricism (both scientific empiricism and philosophical empiricism) are terms that are often discussed in conjunction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Materialism is a form of philosophical monism that holds that matter is the fundamental substance in nature, and that all things, including mental states and consciousness, are results of material interactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Idealism asserts that reality is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. In contrast to materialism, idealism asserts that consciousness creates and determines material existence.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the natural sciences, empiricism is associated with the scientific method and states that "knowledge is based on experience" and that "knowledge is tentative and probabilistic, subject to continued revision and falsification" (Shelley). Sir Francis Bacon was the leading figure of Renaissance empiricism.
            </p>
            <p>
              Philosophical empiricists hold no knowledge to be properly inferred or deduced unless it is derived from one's sense-based experience. John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume were the primary exponents of empiricism during the 18th century Enlightenment. They are the leading figures of the philosophical movement known as British empiricism.
            </p>
            <p>
              Empiricism is commonly contrasted with rationalism, which holds that the mind may apprehend some truths directly, without requiring the medium of the senses. Descartes, Leibniz and Spinoza are the leading rationalists (the Continental Rationalists) of the Enlightenment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Empiricism and rationalism are concerns of epistemology (does knowledge come from the senses or innately through reason?), while idealism and materialism belong to metaphysics (is the world made of matter or ideas?).
            </p>
            <p>
              Descartes sought to ground natural science not in sensation and probability (as did Bacon) but in premises that could be known with absolute certainty:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To employ the procedure of complete and systematic doubt to eliminate every belief that does not pass the test of indubitability.
              </li>
              <li>
                To accept no idea as certain that is not clear, distinct, and free of contradiction.
              </li>
              <li>
                To found all knowledge upon the bedrock certainty of self-consciousness, so that “I think, therefore I am” becomes the only innate idea unshakable by doubt.
              </li>
            </ul>
              From the indubitability of the self, Descartes inferred the existence of a perfect God; and, from the fact that a perfect being is incapable of falsification or deception, he concluded that the ideas about the physical world that God has implanted in human beings must be true.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cartesian philosophy accepted the doctrines of Renaissance science while attempting to ground them in medieval notions of God and the human mind. Thus, a certain dualism between God the Creator and the mechanistic world of his creation, between mind as a spiritual principle and matter (or body) as spatial extension, was inherent in the Cartesian position (Cartesian dualism). This dualism is sometimes referred to as the mind–body problem in philosophy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The term "monism" was introduced in the 18th century by Christian von Wolff to describe philosophical thought that attempted to eliminate the dichotomy of body and mind and explain all phenomena as manifestations of a single substance. Thereafter the term was more broadly used for any theory postulating a unifying principle.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tradition of rationalism was carried on by Benedict de Spinoza and his younger contemporary Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Spinoza conceived of the universe pantheistically as a single infinite substance, which he called “God,” with the dual attributes of thought and extension.
            </p>
            <p>
              Leibniz’s pluralism contrasted with Descartes’s dualism and Spinoza’s monism. Leibniz posited the existence of an infinite number of spiritual substances, which he called "monads".
            </p>
            <p>
              In the "Principles of Nature and of Grace Founded in Reason", Leibniz stated a maxim that could fairly represent the entire school: "True reasoning depends upon necessary or eternal truths, such as those of logic, numbers, geometry, which establish an indubitable connection of ideas and unfailing consequences."
            </p>
            <p>
              The leading figures of British empiricism are John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume.
            </p>
            <p>
              In "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding," John Locke proposed that the only knowledge humans can have is <i>a posteriori</i>, i.e., based upon experience. He said the human mind is a tabula rasa, a "blank slate." Locke believed:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>That the ultimate source of human ideas is sense experience.</li>
              <li>That all mental operations are a combining and compounding of simple sensory materials into complex conceptual entities.</li>
            </ul>
              Locke also made a distinction between “primary qualities” (such as solidity, figure, extension, motion, and rest), which are real properties of physical objects, and “secondary qualities” (such as color, taste, and smell), which are effects of the mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              George Berkeley argued that things only exist either as a result of their being perceived, or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving. He rejected the distinction between primary and secondary qualities and claimed that a physical object are no more than bundles of sense data in the perceiver (phenomenalism).
            </p>
            <p>
              David Hume argued that our belief in the power of cause and effect is not justified by either observation or by logical deduction. We only ever see one thing following another: we never observe any power that makes one thing necessitate an effect. Even if we could be satisfied that we had established x caused y, logic can’t establish any general principle of causation, since all the regularities we have observed in nature were in the past, but the principle of cause and effect is assumed to apply in the present and future. Logically, you can never arrive at a truth about the future based entirely on premises that concern the past.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, Auguste Comte would maintain the empirical tradition through his philosophy of science (positivism), which maintained that valid knowledge was derived through the accepted methods of science.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the terms Middle Ages and Renaissance were not invented until well after the historical periods they designate, scholars of the 18th century called their age “the Enlightenment” with self-conscious enthusiasm and pride. Kant’s death in 1804 formally marked the end of the Enlightenment.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 16th and 17th centuries were the age of absolutism; the chief problem of politics was that of maintaining internal order. As such, the Renaissance political philosophies of Machiavelli, Bodin, and Hobbes had presupposed or defended the absolute power of kings and rulers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 18th century was the age of the democratic revolutions, and the Enlightenment theories of Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau championed the freedom and equality of citizens. The germ of modern liberalism is found in these two theorists: faith in representative democracy, in civil liberties, and in the basic dignity of human beings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Immanuel Kant marks the culmination of the philosophy of the Enlightenment. Kant’s great contribution was to elucidate both the sensory and the a priori elements in knowledge and thus to bridge the gap between the extreme rationalism of Leibniz and the extreme empiricism of Hume.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kant believed that objects must conform to the human apparatus of knowing rather than that human knowledge must conform to objects (transcendental idealism). The question then became: What is the exact nature of this knowing apparatus?
            </p>
            <p>
              As Kant saw it, the problem of metaphysics is to explain how, on the one hand, its principles can be necessary and universal (such being a condition for any knowledge that is scientific) and yet, on the other hand, involve also a knowledge of the real and so provide the investigator with the possibility of more knowledge than is analytically contained in what he already knows—i.e., than is implicit in the meaning alone. To meet these two conditions, Kant maintained, knowledge must rest on judgments that are 1) a priori, for it is only as they are separate from the contingencies of experience that they could be necessary and yet also 2) synthetic—i.e., so that the predicate term contains something more than is analytically contained in the subject. Thus, for example, the proposition that all bodies are extended is not synthetic but analytic because the notion of extension is contained in the very notion of body, whereas the proposition that all bodies are heavy is synthetic because weight supposes, in addition to the notion of body, that of bodies in relation to one another. Hence, the basic problem, as Kant formulated it, is to determine “How [i.e., under what conditions] are synthetic a priori judgments possible?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Kant maintained that physics is a priori and synthetic because in its ordering of experience it uses concepts of a special sort. These concepts — “categories,” he called them — are not so much read out of experience as read <i>into</i> it and, hence, are a priori, or pure, as opposed to empirical. But they differ from empirical concepts in something more than their origin: their whole role in knowledge is different. For, whereas empirical concepts serve to correlate particular experiences and so to bring out in a detailed way how experience is ordered, the categories have the function of prescribing the general form that this detailed order must take. They belong, as it were, to the very framework of knowledge. But although they are indispensable for objective knowledge, the sole knowledge that the categories can yield is of objects of possible experience; they yield valid and real knowledge only when they are ordering what is given through sense in space and time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kant's contributions to ethics include his concept of the categorical imperative, a moral law that is absolute for all agents and does not depend on any ulterior motive. “Thou shalt not steal,” for example, is categorical as distinct from hypothetical imperatives, such as "Do not steal if you want to be popular." Kant offered several formulations of the categorical imperative, including "So act as to treat humanity, whether in your own person or in another, always as an end, and never as only a means."
            </p>
            <p>
              Subjective idealism argues that only minds and mental contents exist. This form of idealism is "subjective" because it asserts that reality is dependent upon the minds of the subjects that perceive it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Objective idealism postulates that there is only one perceiver, and that this perceiver is one with that which is perceived. There is an objective consciousness which exists before and, in some sense, independently of human ones. The absolute idealism of Hegel and others is a form of objective idealism.
            </p>
            <p>
              While earlier "idealists" maintained that reality is ultimately intellectual rather than material (Plato) or that the existence of objects is mind-dependent (Berkeley), the German idealists reject the distinctions these views presuppose.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kant’s holds that the objects of human cognition are transcendentally ideal and empirically real. They are transcendentally ideal, because the conditions of the cognition human beings have of objects are to be found in the cognitive faculties of human beings.
            </p>
            <p>
              The primary representatives of absolute idealism were Johann Fichte, Friedrich Schelling, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Johann Fichte believed that there can be no thing in itself, because a thing is only a thing when it is something for us. Even the thing in itself is, in fact, a product of our own conscious thought, meaning the thing in itself is nothing other a postulation of our own consciousness.
            </p>
            <p>
              Friedrich Schelling maintained that the I is the unconditioned condition of both being and thinking. The existence of the I precedes all thinking (I must exist in order to think) and thinking determines all being (A thing is nothing other than an object of thought).
            </p>
            <p>
              Hegel believed that for the thinking subject (human reason or consciousness) to be able to know its object (the world) at all, there must be in some sense an identity of thought and being. He stated that "the rational is the real" and that "the truth is the whole". He further argued that this "absolute" or "whole" is not static but develops over time. Hegel called this evolution "the dialectical process".
            </p>
            <p>
              In America, there was a strong reaction against idealism fostered the pragmatic movement, led by Charles Sanders Peirce and William James. Peirce held that the function of all inquiry is to eradicate doubt and that the meaning of a concept consists of its practical consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meanwhile, he philosophy of Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche placed an emphasis on the irrational. They viewed the mind as dark, obscure, hidden, and deep.
            </p>
            <p>
              John Stuart Mill social theory was an attempt to combat the evils of the Industrial Revolution. His ethics, expressed in <i>Utilitarianism</i> (1861), built on the formulations of Jeremy Bentham. Mill believed the purpose of society was to produce the greatest quantity of happiness for its members.
            </p>
            <p>
              A radical counterbalance to Mill’s liberal ideas was provided by Karl Marx.  Marx believed that society is a moving balance (dialectic) of antithetical forces that produce social change.
            </p>
            <p>
              There were two main forms of Marxism in the West: that of the traditional communist parties and what came to be known as Western Marxism. Western Marxists were concerned less with the actual political or economic practice of Marxism than with its philosophical interpretation, especially in relation to cultural and historical studies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prominent figures in the evolution of Western Marxism included the central Europeans György Lukács, Karl Korsch, and Lucien Goldmann; Antonio Gramsci of Italy; the German theorists who constituted the Frankfurt School, especially Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, and Jürgen Habermas; and Henri Lefebvre, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty of France.
            </p>
            <p>
              Critical theory is a movement in social and political philosophy. It was originally associated with the Frankfurt School and drew on the work of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud. According to Max Horkheimer, a theory is critical if it seeks human “emancipation from slavery”, acts as a “liberating … influence”, and works “to create a world which satisfies the needs and powers” of human beings (Horkheimer 1972, 246).
            </p>
            <p>
              The origin of analytic philosophy is often attributed to the work of G.E. Moore. In Principia Ethica (1903) Moore argued that the predicate good, which defines the sphere of ethics, is “simple, unanalyzable, and indefinable.” He contended that many of the difficulties in ethics, and indeed in philosophy generally, arose from an “attempt to answer questions, without first discovering precisely what question it is which you desire to answer.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The formalist tradition began with a metaphysical theory known as logical atomism. Its two major proponents, Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein believed that mathematical logic could reveal the basic structure of reality.
            </p>
            <p>
              The logical positivists accepted the logical atomist conception of philosophy as properly scientific and grounded in mathematical logic. Indeed, they believed that only logic, mathematics, and the sciences could make statements that were meaningful. They regarded metaphysical, religious, ethical, literary, and aesthetic pronouncements as nonsense. The main proponents of logical positivism were Rudolf Carnap, Herbert Feigl, Philipp Frank, and Gustav Bergmann.
            </p>
            <p>
              The informalist tradition includes common-sense philosophy, ordinary-language philosophy, and speech-act theory.
