              Let's take a stroll through the yard. Here is a rock. An inanimate object. It is not aware of its surroundings. It is not conscious. It does not know that it is a rock.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next to the rock is a plant. The plant is alive. It has internal cellular processes. It grows and flowers and its flowers follow the sun. It does not have senses like sight or smell, but it does react to certain external stimuli. The plant differs from the rock in these ways and yet it too lacks consciousness. The plant does not know it is a plant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Near the plant is a lizard. The lizard sees and hears and smells things. He knows that some sensory inputs mean food and he should pursue them. Others mean danger and he should flee. His actions are instinctive. He is conscious of his surroundings but does not reflect on them. He is conscious but not self-conscious. He does not know that he is a lizard.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here comes my dog Raja. We play a game. The game is to get the ball. Whoever has the ball wins. He understands that I have a plan to get the ball and he aims to outsmart me. Raja has a basic understanding of self. He knows that he is a dog and that I am not a dog. He knows that I have a plan and that he has a plan. He knows that there are two planning, thinking beings. He does not reflect on the nature of his and my existence, but he is conscious of himself as a distinct entity and me as another.
            </p>
            <p>
              And here I am. I receive input from the world around me. I am conscious of the input and of the "me" that receives it. I reflect on the input and plan for the future. I use language and it plays a large role in my thought processes. I have a sense of self and try to understand the nature of that self.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I try to imagine what it is like to think like Raja, I imagine a wild and happy life with not too many cares about the past or future. I have desires. I want to eat and sleep and play. My thought processes revolve around these issues. I don't think about my purpose in the world or my mortality, but I do understand that I am in the world and that there are other thinking creatures in the world as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              I try to imagine what it is like to be the lizard. I assume that inner life of the lizard involves sensory input and response. The lizard is a machine that reacts to stimuli. He acts instinctively, without reflection. It is hard to understand what this means. What is it like to "think" without a sense of self? To have consciousness without self-consciousness? It is a bit like the proverbial tree falling in the woods. The lizard thinks but does not know that he thinks.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can imagine a future where humans have access to more information about the world around us. I envision devices that enhance sensory input and other devices that increase our ability to process this input. This information and processing ability should make us more knowledgeable our world and our role within it. Our sense of self will evolve as it is situated within this new context. A time may come, when we reflect on the current state of human self-consciousness and find it limited, much as I find the lizard's sense of self limited.
            </p>
            <p>
              My understanding of the world extends from and is dependent on my sense of self. It is hard to imagine this self as being limited because I have no basis for comparison.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consciousness and self-consciousness define the limits of my understanding. They are the field on which my thought takes place. Seeing beyond the borders of this field is like trying to see beyond the borders of the universe.
