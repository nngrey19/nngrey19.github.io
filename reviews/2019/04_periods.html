              Western history has traditionally be divided into three periods: classical antiquity (750 BCE - 500 CE), the medieval period (500 - 1500), and the modern period (1500 - present).
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Classical antiquity</b> began with the poetry of Homer (8th – 7th century BC) and continued through the fall of Western Roman Empire in 476 CE.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <b>Middle Ages</b> started around 476 CE and continued through the fall of Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453 (or the arrival of Columbus in the New World in 1492).
            </p>
            <p>
              The <b>modern period</b> (modern era, modernity) is used to describe the time from the end of the Middle Ages (circa 1500) to the present.
            </p>
            <p>
              The early modern period falls between the Middle Ages and the Industrial Revolution — roughly 1500 to 1800. It is characterized by the rise of science, secularized civic politics, and the nation state. During this time, capitalist economies began to grow, feudalism began a long decline, and the power of the Catholic Church was reduced, especially after the Protestant Reformation. The period included the Renaissance, the Age of Exploration, European colonial expansion, the Scientific revolution, and the Enlightenment.
            </p>
            <p>
              The late modern period began sometime around 1750-1815, as Europe experienced the Industrial Revolution and the military-political turbulence of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. The late modern period continues either to the end of World War II, in 1945, or to the present.

              <b>Scholasticism</b> is a method of learning which emphasizes dialectical thinking (the exchange of thesis and antithesis in pursuit of a synthesis) and syllogistic or deductive reasoning (reasoning from one or more premises to reach a logically certain conclusion). It attempts to reconcile classical philosophy (particularly Aristotle) with Christian theology.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Humanism</b> was a Renaissance movement opposed to Scholastic philosophy. It included a revival of classical letters and an emphasis on secular concerns, reason and the scientific method. Humanists revived the notion that man, not God, is the measure of all things.
            </p>
            <p>
              The European Renaissance was also influenced by several novel inventions from the East, including printing with movable type and the compass. Printing propagated knowledge widely, secularized learning, reduced the intellectual monopoly of an ecclesiastical elite, and restored the literary and philosophical classics of Greece and Rome. The compass increased the safety and scope of navigation, leading to voyages of discovery and new scientific interest in the structure of the natural world.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <b>Scientific Revolution</b> marked the emergence of modern science, when developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology and chemistry transformed views of society. The publication of Nicolaus Copernicus's <i>De revolutionibus orbium coelestium</i> (<i>On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres</i>) in 1543 often cited as the beginning of the Scientific Revolution. Its end is marked by the "grand synthesis" of Isaac Newton's <i>Principia</i> in 1687.
            </p>
            <p>
              The adoption of the <b>scientific method</b>, popularized by Francis Bacon, was an important aspect of the Scientific Revolution. The scientific method requires abandoning preconceived assumptions and promotes the use of systematic experimentation, empirical observation and inductive reasoning (in contrast to the earlier, Aristotelian approach of deduction). (The premises of an inductive argument are viewed as supplying some evidence for the truth of a conclusion. The conclusion of an inductive argument is only probable, based upon the evidence given. The conclusion of a deductive argument is certain.)
            </p>
            <p>
              The <b>Enlightenment</b> emerged from Renaissance humanism. It viewed reason and the evidence of the senses as the primary sources of knowledge and drew inspiration from the Scientific Revolution. Enlightenment thinkers also advanced ideals such as liberty, progress, toleration, fraternity, constitutional government and separation of church and state. They believed that the tremendous intellectual and scientific progress of the age would dramatically improve human society.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the Renaissance and Enlightenment, classical antiquity was held in high regard (Classicism). <b>Neoclassicism</b> was an important art movement during the Enlightenment.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <b>Romantic Movement</b> emphasized emotion and individualism. It glorified the past, nature and the medieval over the classical. Romanticism was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the scientific rationalization of nature.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Realism</b> was an artistic movement that emerged in France in the 1840s. Realism revolted against the exotic subject matter and the exaggerated emotionalism and drama of the Romantic movement. Instead, it sought to depicted people of all classes in situations that arose in ordinary life, and often reflected the changes brought by the Industrial and Commercial Revolutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Modernism</b> is both a philosophical movement and an art movement that arose in the late 19th and early 20th centuries during a time of rapid industrialization, growing urbanization and new ways of understanding the world, including Darwin's Theory of Evolution, Freud's claims about the subconscious mind, and Einstein's Theory of Relativity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The mechanized slaughter of the First World War fueled modernist distrust of reason and called into question the belief in steady moral improvement and social progress that characterized the Enlightenment.
            </p>
            <p>
              For many artists, Realism no longer seemed adequate to capture the changes and horrors of modern world. They introduced new stylistic innovations to reflect the unique nature of the modern world, including the stream-of-consciousness novel, atonal and twelve-tone music, and abstract art.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modernism tends to present a fragmented view of human subjectivity and history (think of The Wasteland, for instance, or of Woolf's To the Lighthouse), but presents that fragmentation as something tragic, something to be lamented and mourned as a loss. Many modernist works try to uphold the idea that works of art can provide the unity, coherence, and meaning which has been lost in most of modern life; art will do what other human institutions fail to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              Postmodernism, in contrast, doesn't lament the idea of fragmentation, provisionality, or incoherence, but rather celebrates that. The world is meaningless? Let's not pretend that art can make meaning then, let's just play with nonsense. <a href="https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~sflores/KlagesPostmodernism.html" target="_blank"><u>Mary Klages</u></a>
