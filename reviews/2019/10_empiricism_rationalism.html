              Rationalists believe there is innate knowledge. Plato believes we have innate knowledge of the Forms, which include mathematical concepts (such as triangles, equality, largeness) and moral concepts (such as goodness, beauty, virtue, piety); Descartes believes that knowledge of his own existence is innate as is the idea of God or perfection and infinity; Leibniz believes that logical principles are innate; Noam Chomsky thinks that the ability to use language (e.g., language rules) is innate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Empiricists believe there is no such thing as innate knowledge, and that instead knowledge is derived from experience (either sensed via the five senses or reasoned via the mind).
            </p>
            <p>
              Locke believed the mind is from birth a blank slate, which gets filled through experience. We first acquire simple ideas through experience, and then recombine those simple ideas in different ways to create more complex ideas.
            </p>

              Berkeley believed that when we perceive something like a table, we are not experiencing a physical thing, but only sensations of it. His theory of idealism posits that material things do not exist, and all reality is purely perceptions of the mind. How can Berkeley be an empiricist if he doesn’t believe in material objects? The central point of empiricism is that we gain knowledge through the senses, and Berkeley believes this is how we acquire all of our knowledge. However, while Locke believed that material objects feed us sensory information, Berkeley believed that God performs that role.

              Hume believes that all of our ideas come from two types of experiences: (1) outward impressions through our five senses and (2) mental operations on these impressions. He writes, “When we think of a golden mountain, we only join two consistent ideas, gold, and mountain, with which we were formerly acquainted.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Hume’s radical skepticism derives from the notion that ideas must be grounded in some impression for them to have any meaning. For example, if I have an idea of an all-powerful divine being, but I’ve never had any impression of something that is all powerful or divine, then my idea is without meaning. He believes that much of traditional philosophy and religion can be dismissed since it fails this test.
