              A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portico"><u>portico</u></a> is a covered porch, often with columns. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonnade"><u>colonnade</u></a> is a long sequence of columns. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entablature"><u>entablature</u></a> is a horizontal decorative band resting on top of a series of columns. Entablatures are commonly divided into the architrave, the frieze, and the cornice. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(architecture)"><u>capital</u></a> is the topmost section of a column, which helps to carry the load. Styles of capitals include doric, ionic and corinthian.

              An interesting <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096459"><u>article</u></a> in the American Sociological Review posits that people use cultural taste (e.g., musical preferences) to reinforce boundaries between themselves and people they don't like. We use our musical tastes to define our identities and promote the idea that our tastes and identities are better than those of others.

              It is Wagner week. I've been watching a 2016 performance of <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> on Met on Demand and reading the chapter on Wagner in Schonberg's <i>The Lives of the Great Composers</i>. In that chapter, Schonberg describes Nietzsche's admiration for Wagner, which got me listening to the episodes on Nietzsche in the <i>Philosophize This</i> podcast. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The first of these episodes references a variety of<a href="https://academyofideas.com/2012/11/nietzsche-and-the-true-world/"><u>True World Theories</u></a>, that people subscribe to in order to answer the question "what is the meaning of life?" These theories hold that there is an imperfect material world in which we live and a perfect "true" world (heaven, the forms) that we can aspire to. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The second episode described the concept of "Will to Power", which is described as realizing one true potential or self-expression. It is why we do things above and beyond self-preservation. Actually, Nietzsche never gives a detailed explanation of the term and people have been trying to interpret what he meant ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
              I found myself thinking about identity and how we actively shape our sense of self - I am an artist, I am an intellectual, I am a country boy. I wonder if the will to power is akin to how we strive to inhabit our identities.
