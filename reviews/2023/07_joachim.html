              <a href="https://youtu.be/f-p8YeIQkxs"><u>Joseph Joachim</u></a> (1831 - 1907) (pronounced Yo-Aah-Chim) was a Hungarian-German violinist and close friend of Brahms. He was also one of the first performers to record his music. Here he plays Brahms Hungarian Dance #1.

              Coincidentally, Ryan likes the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Neugroschel"><u>Joachim Neugroschel</u></a>, a translator of Kafka and others.

              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Corinth_(146_BC)"><u>Melisma</u></a> – a passage of multiple notes sung to one syllable of text, as in Gregorian chant.

              <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/04/17/max-richter-music-review"><u>Max Richter</u></a>, composer and pianist. He had a minimalist period - e.g., <a href="https://youtu.be/rVN1B-tUpgs"><u>On the Nature of Daylight</u></a>. He also interpreted <a href="/17_dante.html"><u>The Four Seasons</u></a>.

              <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/historicity"><u>Isabella Leonarda</u></a>, 1620 – 1704, Italian composer. Her sonata's are among her most popular works, e.g., <a href="https://youtu.be/05OVTqK1p68"><u>no. 10</u></a>. I listened to an episode of Composer of the Week on Hildegard of Bingen and Leonarda.

              This week I read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Wolf"><u>Hugo Wolf</u></a>, who is best known for his leider. I've also started the chapter on Strauss, Offenbach, and Sullivan and found episodes of Composer of the Week on each of them.

              I finished <i>The Furrows</i> by Namwali Serpell. It started strong but descended into confusion, or maybe it was some sort of literary technique – like dream-state – that I could not follow.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started <i>Egypt's Golden Couple</i> by John and Colleen Darnell and <i>I, Claudius</i> by Robert Graves. I read  <i>I, Claudius</i>, or an excerpt of it, when I was a young man. I recall liking it. I hope it is as enjoyable this time around.
