              What is the <a href="https://blog.artgeek.io/2019/10/17/is-it-chiaroscuro-or-is-it-tenebrism/"><u>difference</u></a> between tenebrism and chiaroscuro? Tenebrism, or dramatic illumination, is used to achieve a spotlight effect. Some areas of the painting are completely black while others are illuminated, usually from a single source of light. Chiaroscuro (kee-AR-É™-SKOOR-oh) is a (less extreme) contrast of light and dark used to create the illusion of three-dimensional form.

              <b>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_in_the_Protestant_Reformation_and_Counter-Reformation"><u>impact</u></a> of the reformation and counter-reformation on art.</b>
            </p>  
            <p>
              The Reformation began in 1517 when Martin Luther posted his Ninety-five Theses. This movement lead to the creation of two main branches of Protestantism - the Evangelical Lutheran churches, which followed the teachings of Luther, and the Reformed Churches, which followed the ideas of John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli.

              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Trent"><u>The Council of Trent</u></a>, 1545 - 1563, was a council of the Catholic Church prompted by the Protestant Reformation. It has been described as the embodiment of the Counter-Reformation.
            </p>     
            <p>
              The Reformed Churches removed religious imagery, while the Lutheran churches offered guidance on what types of imagery were appropriate. The Council of Trent also offered guidance on what type of imagery was appropiate.
