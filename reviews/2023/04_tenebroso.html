              What is the difference between <a href="https://blog.artgeek.io/2019/10/17/is-it-chiaroscuro-or-is-it-tenebrism/"><u>tenebrism and chiaroscuro</u></a>? Tenebrism, or dramatic illumination, is used to achieve a spotlight effect. Some areas of the painting are completely black while others are illuminated, usually from a single source of light. Chiaroscuro (kee-AR-ə-SKOOR-oh) is a (less extreme) contrast of light and dark used to create the illusion of three-dimensional form.

              <b>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_in_the_Protestant_Reformation_and_Counter-Reformation"><u>impact</u></a> of the reformation and counter-reformation on art.</b>
            </p>  
            <p>
              The Reformation began in 1517 when Martin Luther posted his Ninety-five Theses. Over time, it lead to the creation of the two main branches of Protestantism – the Evangelical Lutheran churches, which followed the teachings of Luther, and the Reformed Churches, which followed the teachings of John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli.
            </p>   
            <p>
              The Catholic Church responded to the Protestant Reformation with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Trent"><u>The Council of Trent</u></a>, 1545 - 1563, which has been described as the embodiment of the Counter-Reformation.
            </p>     
            <p>
              The Reformed Church removed religious imagery, while the Lutheran church and the Council of Trent provided guidance on what type of imagery was appropiate.

              <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/leaguer"><u>Leaguer</u></a> – a military camp, a siege, see beleaguer. Another word from Lievely's <i>Moon Tiger</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              I finally finished Penelope Lively's <i>Moon Tiger</i>. It is a readable, relatable, powerful novel. I am surprised by how good it is. THe story is melancholy, and a bit fantastic, and yet it does such a good job of describing the human condition - or rather, capturing some of the emotional complexity of life - that you can't help but nod in agreement. Somehow truth, even if it is difficult, is reassuring.

              The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seikilos_epitaph"><u>Seikilos epitaph</u></a> is the oldest surviving complete musical composition.

              I reread Martha Wells <i>Exit Strategy</i>, the 4th installment in the Muderbot Diaries series. I can't keep track of how far I have gotten in this series, so I keep checking out the same volumes. At least, I did not remember much. IN all honesty, it is not terribly memorable writing, just a lot of fun.
