              What is the <a href="https://blog.artgeek.io/2019/10/17/is-it-chiaroscuro-or-is-it-tenebrism/"><u>difference</u></a> between tenebrism and chiaroscuro? Tenebrism, or dramatic illumination, is used to achieve a spotlight effect. Some areas of the painting are completely black while others are illuminated, usually from a single source of light. Chiaroscuro (kee-AR-É™-SKOOR-oh) is a (less extreme) contrast of light and dark used to create the illusion of three-dimensional form.

              <b>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_in_the_Protestant_Reformation_and_Counter-Reformation"><u>impact</u></a> of the reformation and counter-reformation on art.</b>
            </p>  
            <p>
              The Reformation began in 1517 when Martin Luther posted his Ninety-five Theses. Over time, it lead to the creation of the two main branches of Protestantism - the Evangelical Lutheran churches, which followed the teachings of Luther, and the Reformed Churches, which followed the ideas of John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli.

              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Trent"><u>The Council of Trent</u></a>, 1545 - 1563, was a council of the Catholic Church prompted by the Protestant Reformation. It has been described as the embodiment of the Counter-Reformation.
            </p>     
            <p>
              The Reformed Church removed religious imagery, while the Lutheran church and the Council of Trent offered guidance on what type of imagery was appropiate.

              <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/leaguer"><u>leaguer</u></a> - a military camp, a siege, see beleaguer, from Lievely's <i>Moon Tiger</i>,

            <p>
              I finished Penelope Lively's <i>Moon Tiger</i>. I am a bit blown away. It is a readable, relatable, powerful novel. It is sad and yet it seems to capture something of the human condition, and so you just want to say "yes, this is right" and somehow that is empowering.
