              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenebrism"><u>Tenebrism</u></a>, from Italian tenebroso ("dark, gloomy, mysterious"), also occasionally called dramatic illumination, is a style of painting using especially pronounced chiaroscuro, where there are violent contrasts of light and dark, and where darkness becomes a dominating feature of the image. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Calling_of_St_Matthew#/media/File:The_Calling_of_Saint_Matthew-Caravaggo_(1599-1600).jpg"><u>The Calling of St Matthew</u></a>.

              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaroscuro"><u>Chiaroscuro</u></a> (kee-AR-É™-SKOOR-oh, Italian for 'light-dark'), is the use of strong contrasts between light and dark, usually bold contrasts affecting a whole composition.

              What is the <a href="https://blog.artgeek.io/2019/10/17/is-it-chiaroscuro-or-is-it-tenebrism/"><u>difference</u></a> between tenebrism and chiaroscuro? Tenebrism is used to achieve a spotlight effect. Some areas of the painting are completely black, allowing others to be illuminated, usually from a single source of light. Chiaroscuro is a less extreme contrast of light and shade used to create the illusion of three-dimensional form.

              <b>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_in_the_Protestant_Reformation_and_Counter-Reformation"><u>impact</u></a> of the reformation and counter-reformation on art.</b>
            </p>  
            <p>
              The Reformation produced two main branches of Protestantism - the Evangelical Lutheran churches, which followed the teachings of Martin Luther, and the Reformed Churches, which followed the ideas of John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli.
            </p>        
            <p>
              The Reformed Churches removed religious imagery, while the Lutheran churches offered guidance on what types of imagery were appropriate.

              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Trent"><u>The Council of Trent</u></a>, 1545 - 1563, was a council of the Catholic Church prompted by the Protestant Reformation. It has been described as the embodiment of the Counter-Reformation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Council of Trent also offered guidance on what type of imagery was appropiate.
