              Reginaldo degli Scrovegni was a 14th money-lender or usurer, which was considered a mortal sin at the time. Dante placed Reginaldo in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginaldo_degli_Scrovegni" target="_blank"><u>Seventh Circle of Hell</u></a>. Reginaldo's son, Enrico, was also a money-lender. Enrico was so concerned about the spiritual ramifications of his vocation that he built the Scrovegni Chapel in order to reclaim his soul.

              Enrico commissioned Giotto to paint the frescos around the interior of the Scrovegni Chapel. Giotto's work, which is more naturalistic than most art of the period, is seen as a harbinger of the Renaissance.

              I enjoyed John LeCarre's <i>Call for the Dead</i>, and I am now reading Jennifer Egan's Candy House.

              I am also enjoying Robert Schumann (it is his week) more than anticipated. It looks like there will be a whole slew of pianists (and composers for the piano) in the next several weeks - Schumann, Chopin, Liszt, Mendelssohn. This trend may be related to the evolution of the piano, which had recently become a more powerful and sophisticated instrument.
