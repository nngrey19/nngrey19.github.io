              Reginaldo degli Scrovegni was a 14th century money-lender (or usurer). At that time, usury was considered a mortal sin. In fact, usurers were so reviled that Dante placed them in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginaldo_degli_Scrovegni" target="_blank"><u>Seventh Circle of Hell</u></a>, and he specifically included Reginaldo. Reginaldo's son, Enrico, was also a money-lender, but he was so concerned about the spiritual ramifications of his vocation that he built the Scrovegni Chapel in order to restore his relationship with God.

              Enrico commissioned Giotto to paint the frescos around the interior of the Scrovegni Chapel. Giotto's work, which is more naturalistic than most art of the period, is seen as a harbinger of the Renaissance.

              I enjoyed John LeCarre's <i>Call for the Dead</i>, and I am now reading Jennifer Egan's <i>Candy House</i>.

              I am also enjoying Robert Schumann (it's Schumann week) more than anticipated. It looks like there will be a series of pianists (and composers for the piano) in the next several weeks - Schumann, Chopin, Liszt, Mendelssohn. This fact may be related to the technical evolution of the piano, which was becoming a more powerful and sophisticated instrument.
