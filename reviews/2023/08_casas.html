              We went to the Portland Baroque Orchestra's final concert of the season, A Mozart Jubilee. The program included the Sinfonia Concertante in F Major for Two Violins and Viola, Op. 10/1 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevalier_de_Saint-Georges" target="_blank"><u>Joseph Bologne</u></a>, a French Creole, virtuoso violinist and composer, and a free man of color conducting leading orchestras in Paris.

              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._T._A._Hoffmann" target="_blank"><u>ETA (Ernst Theodor Amadeus) Hoffmann</u></a>, 1776 – 1822, German Romantic author of fantasy and Gothic horror. His stories form the basis of Jacques Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which Hoffmann appears (heavily fictionalized) as the hero.

              <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/04/17/max-richter-music-review" target="_blank"><u>Max Richter</u></a>, composer and pianist. He had a minimalist period - e.g., <a href="https://youtu.be/rVN1B-tUpgs" target="_blank"><u>On the Nature of Daylight</u></a>. He also interpreted <a href="/reviews/2022/17_dante.html" target="_blank"><u>The Four Seasons</u></a>.

              <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/historicity" target="_blank"><u>Isabella Leonarda</u></a>, 1620 – 1704, Italian composer. Her sonata's are among her most popular works, e.g., <a href="https://youtu.be/05OVTqK1p68" target="_blank"><u>no. 10</u></a>. I listened to an episode of Composer of the Week on Hildegard of Bingen and Leonarda.

              This week I read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Wolf" target="_blank"><u>Hugo Wolf</u></a>, who is best known for his leider. I've also started the chapter on Strauss, Offenbach, and Sullivan in <i>The Lives of the Great Composers</i> and found episodes of Composer of the Week on each of them. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I finished <i>The Furrows</i> by Namwali Serpell. It started strong but descended into confusion, or maybe it was some sort of literary technique – like dream-state – that I simply could not follow.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started <i>Egypt's Golden Couple</i> by John and Colleen Darnell and <i>I, Claudius</i> by Robert Graves. I read <i>I, Claudius</i>, or an excerpt of it, when I was a young man and recall liking it. I hope it is as enjoyable this time around.
