              I finished Barbara Pym's <i>A Glass of Blessings</i>. Lovely, restrained, engaging. My mother loved Pym's books and now I know why. I also have Penelope Lively on my radar.

              I just started LeCarre's <i>Call for the Dead</i>, the first in the George Smiley series. I had been waiting to get through his other novels before starting the Smiley series, but honestly, I had lost track of where I was, and after finishing <i>A Glass of Blessings</i>, I was desperate for something more to read. None of my other library holds were ready.

              Carl Marie von Weber week has concluded, and now it is time for Hector Berlioz. I am vaguely dreading the Romantics. I fear the sturm and drang may be too much for me, but we will see.

              This weekend, I bought some sewing material. Jim will be giving me my first lesson (making an apron) later in the the month.
