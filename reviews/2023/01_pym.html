              I finished Barbara Pym's <i>A Glass of Blessings</i>. Lovely, quite, engaging. My mother loved her books and now I do too. I also have Penelope Lively on my radar.

              Just started LeCarre's <i>Call for the Dead</i>, the first in the George Smiley series. I had been waiting to get through his other novels before starting the Smiley series, but I lost track of where I was and was desperate for something to read. None of my library holds are ready.

              I finished Carl Marie von Weber week, and now I have moved on to Hector Berlioz. I am somewhat dreading the Romantics. I fear the sturm and drang may be too much for me, but we will see.

              Also I bought some sewing material. Jim will be giving me my first lesson later in the the month.
