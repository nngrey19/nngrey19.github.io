              In "The Beginnings of Roman Literature" (<a href="https://literatureandhistory.com/index.php/episode-042-the-beginnings-of-roman-literature"><u>episode 42</u></a>), Doug Metz notes that there was a concentration of literary activity in Rome from 100 BC to 100 AD.

              The <a href="https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/Z/Zodiac"><u>zodiac</u></a> is a belt shaped region of the sky that stretches about 8-9 degrees either side of the ecliptic (the region of sky through which the Sun appears to move). It is the region of the sky where we find the Sun, Moon and planets (except for Pluto). The zodiac is narrow because most of the planets have orbits that are only slightly inclined to that of the Earth.

              It is Wagner week. I've been watching a 2016 performance of <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> on Met on Demand and reading the chapter on Wagner in Schonberg's <i>The Lives of the Great Composers</i>. In that chapter, Schonberg describes Nietzsche's admiration for Wagner, which got me listening to the episodes on Nietzsche in the <i>Philosophize This</i> podcast.

              The first of these episodes references a variety of <a href="https://academyofideas.com/2012/11/nietzsche-and-the-true-world/"><u>True World Theories</u></a>, that people subscribe to in order to answer the question "what is the meaning of life?" These theories hold that there is an imperfect material world in which we live and a perfect "true" world (heaven, the forms) that we can aspire to. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The second episode discussed the concept of "Will to Power", which is described variously as self-actualization, realizing one's true potential and self-expression. It is why we do things above and beyond self-preservation. Actually, Nietzsche never gives a very detailed or exact definition of the term.
            </p>  
            <p>
              I found myself thinking about identity and how we actively shape our sense of self - I am an artist, I am an intellectual, I am a country boy. I wonder if the will to power is akin to our efforts to find and inhabit our identities.

              The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_International_Film_Festival"><u>Berlin International Film Festival</u></a>, usually called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:De-Berlinale2.ogg"><u>Berlinale</u></a>, is one of the "Big Three" film festivals in Europe, alongside the Venice Film Festival and the Cannes Film Festival.
