              I finished <i>The Netanyahus</i> by Joshua Cohen. The novel depicts a fictionalized encounter between Harold Bloom and Benzion Netanyahu and his family, including the young Benjamin. The novel is very writerly and the back story is engaging. I struggled in places, e.g. the letter of "recommendation" to Prof Blum - did we need this much epistolary character development? - but I eventually made it through.
