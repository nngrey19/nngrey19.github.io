            For my last birthday, Anne gave me a subscription to the Literary Arts virtual season. Tonight, we watched a lecture by Ibram X. Kendi. Not surprisingly, given her work, Anne is a big fan.

            The lecture inspired me to jot down a couple thoughts on racism. I think racism arises out of our innate fear of difference combined with a desire to define our own identity and to articulate a narrative about our purpose or our meaning in the world. Sometimes, we define ourselves in opposition to something else.
          </p>
          <p>
            These impulses can be cultivated or manipulated by people for selfish reasons. (N.B. Kenneth Burke's concept of the "other".) I think we have seen a lot this in Trump's rhetoric around immigration and Black Lives Matter. Trump and his accomplices exploit natural human impulses for personal gain. In so doing, transform fealing of fear, doubt and suspicion into much uglier emotions about race and white identify.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another factor in all this is the notion of white privilege, which I have previosly understood as a benefit that accrues to white people that they do not always perceive. There is an episode of Seinfeld that describes the "bubble" that beautiful people live in and all the benefits that come to them, which they assume are normal. I sometimes think of white privilege as this sort of bubble.
          </p>
          <p>
            W.E.B. DuBois had a similar notion, which he referred to as "the wages of whiteness." This is a useful concept that describes the value white people gain by distinguishing themselves from black people of the same station or class. Whiteness, in this equation, becomes an asset in an of itself. It has no inherent value aside from the value we confer upon it. But by creating this new racial economy, we find oursleves in a superior position. Our new found wealth has numerous psychological benefits and even material benefits. (Consider also the health gradient and the Whitehall Studies).
