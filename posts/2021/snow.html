          <p class="first-p">Today, Portland got its first (and probably last) snow of 2021. Anne and I took Raja for a walk in Washington Park. He bounced around quite a bit. The snow has not been very heavy but it has come down steadily throughout the day. It has been years since I have seen it snow for more than a few hours.</p>
